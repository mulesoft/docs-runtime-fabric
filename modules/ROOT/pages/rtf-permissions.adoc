== Runtime Fabric Core Software Permissions

The following table lists all the Kubernetes resource access authorizations used by Runtime Fabric core software.
These RBAC (Role-based access control) configurations (`ClusterRole` and `Rolebindings`) are part of the Runtime Fabric helm charts and are automatically applied during the installation.

[NOTE]
You can't extend or modify any of these core software access permissions. Instead, create and apply the `ClusterRole` and `Rolebindings` for the Runtime Fabric Authorized namespaces use case. Refer to xref:authorized-namespaces.adoc[].
