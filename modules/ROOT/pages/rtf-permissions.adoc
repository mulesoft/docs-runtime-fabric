= Runtime Fabric Core Software Kubernetes Permissions

The following table lists the Kubernetes access permissions required by the Runtime Fabric agent. 
These access permissions are part of the Runtime Fabric helm chart and are automatically applied during the installation or upgrade.

[NOTE]
You can't extend or modify any of these core software access permissions. Instead, create and apply the `ClusterRole` and `Rolebindings` for the Runtime Fabric Authorized namespaces use case. Refer to xref:authorized-namespaces.adoc[].
