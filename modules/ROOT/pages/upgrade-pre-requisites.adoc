= Upgrade Pre-requisites 

For all OpenShift upgrades from versions 2.6.52 and earlier to versions 2.7.0 and later, you must manually increase the `rtfd` container resources to the desired values. See xref:runtime-fabric::rtf-scale.adoc[Scalability Benchmarks] for guidance on `rtfd` container resource values.

To update `rtfd` container resources: 

. In the Red Hat OpenShift console, navigate to *Operators* > *Installed Operators*.
. Select the *Runtime Fabric* operator and open the Runtime Fabric instance `.yaml` file.

. In the `.yaml` file, go to  `spec:` > `agent:` > `rtfd:`, and update the resource allocations to recommended values.

. Click *Save*.

[NOTE]
For Helm-based upgrades, if the Helm-based installations had previously overridden `rtfd` container resources in the `values.yaml` file, then you must manually increase the allocations as per scalability guidelines, as Helm-based upgrades respect pre-release manual overrides.
