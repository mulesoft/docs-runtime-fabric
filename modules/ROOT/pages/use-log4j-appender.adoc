= Integrating with Your Logging System Using Log4j

include::reuse::partial$eol-banner.adoc[tag=eolFeatureScheduled]

You can use a Log4j appender to integrate your logging system with applications deployed to Runtime Fabric.

You can use any Log4j appender. For information about configuring `log4j2.xml`, see the
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html#ConfigurationSyntax[Log4j Configuration Syntax^].

== Requirements and Restrictions

* Using a Log4j appender and external log forwarding at the same time might lead to duplicate log collection. Use one or the other.  
* MuleSoft Support doesn't assist in implementing custom logging configurations or resolving issues caused by custom logging configurations.
* MuleSoft is not responsible for issues arising from misconfiguration of your Log4j appender, including these or other issues:
** Lost logging data
** Performance degradation
** Running out of disk space
* Do not use synchronous log appenders.
+
You can use only asynchronous log appenders.
* File appenders, such as FileAppender, RollingFileAppender, AnypointMonitoringFileAppender, and RandomAccessFileAppender, are removed automatically.
* When using custom Log4j configurations, both Mule runtime engine and application logs remain available in Anypoint Monitoring.

== Enabling Log4j 

Custom Log4j configurations are enabled by default. When you install Runtime Fabric, the parameter is enabled in `Values.yaml`. Even though the value is set to `true`, you must add an appender. To disable Log4j, set the value to `false`.

== Example: Create a Log4j Configuration Using Splunk

For logs to be viewable in Runtime Fabric and flow to Splunk, configure the `SplunkHttp` Log4j appender.

To enable the Log4j appender:

. Update the `log4j2.xml` configuration file with your logger settings and include the `SplunkHttp` Log4j appender.
+
In Anypoint Studio, the `log4j2.xml` file is located in the `src/main/resources` directory.

For the latest version of Splunk, see https://github.com/splunk/splunk-library-javalogging/tags[GitHub^].


After your application starts, logs start flowing to your custom Log4j appender, and you can view them on your target logging system.
