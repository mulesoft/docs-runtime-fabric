= Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes

Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes enables you to deploy Mule applications and API proxies to a Kubernetes cluster that you create, configure, and manage. Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes runs as a service in existing Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) environments.

== Core Components of Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes 

Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes and its underlying components run as Kubernetes deployment objects in EKS, AKS, or GKE environments. You manage the objects via Anypoint Platform.

Linux-based operating systems are required for all nodes that run Runtime Fabric components on self-managed Kubernetes clusters.

=== The Runtime Fabric Agent

The Runtime Fabric agent is deployed as a pod in the cluster and communicates with the control plane via an mTLS outbound connection established at startup. 

The agent is event-driven. When an application state change generates a Kubernetes event, the agent sends metadata describing the current state of the application to the control plane. Kubernetes events include application pod starts, updates, or restarts.

The agent also listens for incoming requests from the control plane. When the agent receives a message from the control plane, the agent makes changes to the Kubernetes resources specified in the message. Such changes include creating a new application, updating an existing application, or deleting an application. 

=== Additional Cluster Components

The following Runtime Fabric components also run inside the Kubernetes cluster: 

* Mule cluster IP service: Provides an API that Mule applications use to discover their peers inside the cluster
* Resource cache: Provides a cluster-local cache of application dependencies
* Persistence gateway: Provides a persistent ObjectStore interface to Mule applications

=== About Component Installations and Upgrades

When you install Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes on your Kubernetes cluster, the command-line utility (`rtfctl`) swaps an activation data token for a set of activation properties. Properties include credentials to access the Runtime Fabric Docker registry and credentials to establish an mTLS connection to Anypoint Platform. The utility then invokes Helm to perform the installation. 

You trigger upgrades to the Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes components in your cluster from the Anypoint Platform control plane, specifically from Runtime Manager. When you trigger an upgrade, an upgrade message is processed inside the target cluster, and `rtfctl` invokes Helm to upgrade the components' software versions. If you encounter a problem during an upgrade, you can use `rtfctl` to invoke a Helm rollback and restore the cluster to a stable state. A rollback creates a report in the control plane.

== How Application Deployments Work in Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes 

When you deploy an application in Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes, the following occurs:

. You use Runtime Manager to trigger the application deployment.
. The Runtime Fabric agent in the target cluster receives a request to deploy the application.
. Runtime Fabric assigns the application to an existing namespace or creates a new namespace if necessary.
. Runtime Fabric generates the appropriate Kubernetes resources, including a deployment, ConfigMap, secrets, services, and ingress.
. If the Kubernetes deployment resource includes an init container, it fetches dependencies from the Runtime Fabric resource cache.
. If the resource cache doesn’t contain required dependencies, Runtime Fabric fetches them from the control plane and adds them to the resource cache.

=== Assigning Namespaces in Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes

Each application is deployed into a Kubernetes namespace based on the application’s environment. 

. Runtime Fabric searches for a namespace with the label `rtf.mulesoft.com/envId=<ANYPOINT_ENVIRONMENT_ID>`. 
. If Runtime Fabric can't find that label, it searches for a namespace with the name `<ANYPOINT_ENVIRONMENT_ID>`. 
. If Runtime Fabric can't find that namespace, it creates a new namespace called `<ANYPOINT_ENVIRONMENT_ID>`.

=== Monitoring Application Deployments

The Runtime Fabric agent monitors Kubernetes Deployments labelled with `rtf.mulesoft.com/id`. When Kubernetes updates the state of the deployment, the agent sends that update to the control plane. See xref:logs[Logs] and xref:monitoring[Monitoring] for addtional information.

* At least 250 GiB of available disk space

Adjust the number of nodes and amount of resources allocated according to the amount and type of workload you run on each Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes instance.

=== Anypoint Platform Roles and Permissions

To successfully use Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes, your Anypoint Platform account must have the following permissions enabled:

* To manage permissions for Anypoint Platform users, you must have the ability to use xref:access-management::index.adoc[Anypoint Access Management].
* To deploy and manage applications, you must have the ability to use Anypoint Runtime Manager. To deploy applications, you must also have the Exchange Contributors permission enabled for your Anypoint Platform account.
* To use Runtime Fabric, you must have the Organization Administrators permission or the Manage Runtime Fabrics permission for the corresponding environments.
* To delete Runtime Fabric instances, administrators need the Manage Runtime Fabrics permission at the organization level.

=== Network Configuration

Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes requires an IT administrator to configure network ports, hostnames, and certificates to function correctly. See xref:install-self-managed.adoc[Install Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes].

=== Anypoint Platform Roles and Permissions

To succesfully use Runtime Fabric, your Anypoint Platform account must have the following permissions enabled:

* To manage permissions for Anypoint Platform users, you must have the ability to use xref:access-management::index.adoc[Anypoint Access Management].
* To deploy and manage applications, you must have the ability to use Anypoint Runtime Manager. To deploy applications, you must also have the Exchange Contributors permission enabled for your Anypoint Platform account.

=== Ingress Controller

Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes supports any ingress controller that is compatible with your Kubernetes environment and supports a deployment model where a separate ingress resource is created per application deployment. In general, most off-the-shelf ingress controllers support this model.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For GKE customers, the ingress controller included with GKE provisions a separate HTTP load balancer per application by default. Before using the ingress controller provided by GKE, learn more about its behavior, exploring workarounds, or using another ingress controller if this behavior is undesirable. See link:https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/Default-Ingress-Controller-Behavior-with-Runtime-Fabric-on-GKE[KB article] for more details.
====

=== Logs

Applications deployed on Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes direct logs to `stdout`. The container runtime collects these logs and writes them to a file. The storage location of this file depends on your container runtime and configuration. Refer to the documentation for your Kubernetes environment for details.
  
=== External Log Forwarding

Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes does not include external log forwarding. You are responsible for installing, configuring, and managing an external log forwarder. You can use any external log forwarding agent that is compatible with your Kubernetes environment running on Amazon EKS, AKS, or GKE. Common log forwarding agents include:

* Splunk Connect for Kubernetes
* Fluentbit

For Titanium customers, Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes supports logging using Anypoint Monitoring. See xref:monitoring::logs.adoc[Logs in Anypoint Monitoring] for more information.

=== Monitoring

xref:monitoring::index.adoc[Anypoint Monitoring] provides metrics for applications and API gateways deployed to Runtime Fabric. 

To collect metrics, Anypoint Monitoring sidecars run in all applications deployed to Runtime Fabric. See xref:manage-monitor-applications.adoc[Monitor Applications Deployed to Runtime Fabric] for details, including how to enable or disable monitoring. 

Runtime Fabric does not provide support for integrating third-party monitoring solutions.
