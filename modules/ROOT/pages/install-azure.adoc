This topic describes how to install Anypoint Runtime Fabric on VMs / Bare Metal on your Azure account. Note that you can also use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to install xref:index-self-managed.adoc[Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes].

== Before You Begin

Before installing Anypoint Runtime Fabric on VMs / Bare Metal on Azure, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have xref:install-create-rtf-arm.adoc[created a Runtime Fabric in Runtime Manager].
* You have reviewed the xref:index.adoc#shared-responsibility-for-on-premises-runtime-fabric[Shared Responsibility for Runtime Fabric on VMs / Bare Metal documentation]. If your infrastructure does not meet the minimum hardware, operating system,
and networking requirements, Runtime Fabric cannot operate successfully.
* You have engaged your organization's operations, networking, and security teams. See
xref:install-prereqs.adoc[Anypoint Runtime Fabric Installation Prerequisites].
* Your Anypoint user account has the *Manage Runtime Fabrics* permission.
* Your Azure user has access to create VMs, Disks, Virtual Networks, and Network Security Groups.
* Your Azure account has enough quota for the infrastructure being provisioned.
* If your organization does not allow using public IPs for VMs, you may need to use an existing Virtual Network.
Modify the Azure Resource Manager template to reference an existing Virtual Network.
* You have disabled any antivirus agents, such as McAfee, running in your environment.
* Note that Runtime Fabric only supports instances of RHEL with Logical Volume Manager (LVM) on Azure Bare Metal. Non-LVM instances of RHEL on Azure Bare Metal are not supported.


== Installation

The Azure Resource Manager templates provided as part of the installation package are for reference only and should not be used as-is for either non-production or production Runtime Fabric installations. You must review and customize these templates to meet your needs. Runtime Fabric on VMs / Bare Metal is supported as long as you meet or exceed the minimum requirements specified in xref:install-prereqs.adoc[Runtime Fabric Installation Prerequisites].

If you require assistance, contact your MuleSoft representative.

Before installing Runtime Fabric on VMs / Bare Metal, download the Azure Resource Manager template from Runtime Manager:

. From Anypoint Platform, navigate to Runtime Manager.
. Select *Runtime Fabrics*.
. Click on the Runtime Fabric you created. It should be in the `Activating` state.
. Click the *Download files* link.
. After the file has downloaded, unzip the `rtf-install-scripts.zip` file.
+
The `rtf-install-scripts\azure` directory contains the following installation files:
+
* `ARM-template-dev.template`: A sample Azure Resource Manager template that describes the required infrastructure for
a development configuration.
* `ARM-template-prod.template`: A sample Azure Resource Manager template that describes the required infrastructure for a
production configuration.
* `generate-templates.sh`: A shell script that is used to insert the Mule Enterprise license digest and initialization
script in the Azure Resource Manager templates. This script outputs the JSON templates to use when deploying to Azure.
+
Copy the supplied sample templates and modify them based on your target topology and infrastructure requirements.

== Base64 Encode your Mule License Key

Run the `generate-templates.sh` script to add the Mule Enterprise license key in the Azure Resource Manager templates.
These templates are used to provision the infrastructure needed.

[NOTE]
On Windows, you must have a shell terminal emulator (such as cygwin) or access to a Unix-based computer.

. Locate your organization's Mule Enterprise license key file (`license.lic`) and transfer the file to your
Unix environment if necessary.
. Open a terminal/shell and navigate to the `azure` sub-directory.
. Copy the following to a text editor:
+
----
RTF_MULE_LICENSE='' \
./generate-templates.sh
----

. Using the terminal, encode the Mule Enterprise license key to base64 and paste the contents as the
value for `RTF_MULE_LICENSE` in your text editor.
+
----
base64 -w0 license.lic # Linux

base64 -b0 license.lic # OSX / MacOS
----

. Copy the command from the text editor and run in the terminal pointed to the `azure` directory.
. Confirm the generated output of the `ARM-template-dev.json` and `ARM-template-prod.json` files in the `azure` directory.

== Deploy using the ARM Template

Run the generated ARM template to provision the infrastructure on your Azure account. The following procedures
describe how to run the template via the Azure Portal.

[NOTE]
You must have a private and public key as a PEM file to provision the VMs. This is required to enable secure
access to your VMs via SSH (Secure Shell).

. Log into your https://portal.azure.com[Azure portal].
. Navigate to *Create a resource*.
. From the *Search the marketplace* search bar, enter *Template deployment*.
. Click *Create* on the bottom of the window.
. Select *Build your own template in the editor*.
. In the bar above the editor, click *Load file* and select the desired Azure Resource Manager template from
the `azure` directory. You must select a JSON file.
. When the file contents appears in the editor, click *Save*.
. Verify your Subscription selection, Resource group, and Region for your environment. In general, you should
create a separate Resource group.
. Under *Settings*, enter the following:

In Runtime Fabric on VMs / Bare Metal, the inbound load balancer runs in either shared or dedicated mode:
+
* *Shared Mode* enables you to specify the number of CPU cores and amount of memory for the internal load balancer. In shared mode, the internal load balancer is distributed across the controller nodes. *Shared Mode* is the default setting.
* *Dedicated Mode* specifies that all available resources are dedicated to the internal load balancer, so you cannot choose the number of CPU cores and memory amount. In dedicated mode, the internal load balancer is deployed on dedicated internal load balancer nodes.
+
Refer to xref:manage-index.adoc[Manage Runtime Fabric] for detailed information.

. Review and select the *Terms and Conditions* on the bottom of the page and then click *Purchase*.
+
Runtime Fabric on VMs / Bare Metal is installed across all servers to form a cluster. This process takes time to complete. When
complete, the status of Runtime Fabric displayed in Runtime Manager changes to `Active` status.
+
[NOTE]
====

* By default, the ARM templates are configured to set a public IP address for each VM. Modify the template to
remove `publicIPAddresses`, if necessary.
* The internal load balancer is distributed across the controller nodes for shared mode and is deployed on the internal load balancer nodes for dedicated mode.

== Monitoring Installation Progress

To follow the Azure provisioning process, follow these steps:

. On the left navigation bar in the Azure Portal, click on *Resource groups*.
. Select the Resource group used to provision your Runtime Fabric infrastructure.
. On the *Overview* pane under *Deployments*, click on the link below. This link should display something
similar to `1 Deploying`.
. Click the Deployment Name *Microsoft.Template*.

You should be able to see the list of infrastructure and its status. Click *Refresh* button to update the pane and status.

To view the progress during the installation, you can tail the output log on each VM:

. Open a shell (or SSH session) to the VM.
. Tail the output log, located at `/var/log/rtf-init.log`
+
----
tail -f /var/log/rtf-init.log
----

You can tail the same log on each VM to view its progress.

When the installation completes successfully, the `/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric/.state/init-complete` file is created.

== Common Errors

Depending on the policies set and the quotas defined with your Azure account, you may encounter errors during
the provisioning process. The ARM template can be modified to accommodate the policies set by your organization.
Consult your network administrator as needed.

* *Exceed max core quota:* file a ticket with Azure Support to increase quota for your deployment region. If you
believe you have enough quota, ensure the correct region is selected with the increased quota. Also, try modifying
the Resource Group name to ensure it is unique to your account.
* *Network policy violation:* By default, the Network Security Groups defined in the Azure Resource Template are
associated at the subnet level and the NIC for each VM. Depending on your company's policy, you may need to adjust
the template to remove an association.

== Access Ops Center

After installation is completed successfully, log in to Ops Center to view that status of your Runtime Fabric
infrastructure. See xref:using-opscenter.adoc[Using Ops Center on Anypoint Runtime Fabric] for information on
accessing Ops Center and determining the Ops Center username and password.

[NOTE]
By default, the Resource Manager script configures the Azure Network Security Group to not expose the Ops Center port
to the internet. To use a public IP to manage your cluster using the Ops Center, the controller nodes must be
provisioned with a public IP. Update your
Network Security Group to allow 0.0.0.0 internet access for TCP connections on port 32009.
