= Limitations (Anypoint Runtime Fabric on VMs / Bare Metal)

The following information is important when installing, configuring, and managing Anypoint Runtime Fabric on VMs / Bare Metal.


== Node, Environment, and Group Limitations

The following table lists important limitations for configuring Runtime Fabric:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Component   | Limitation
| Controller nodes | The maximum number of controller nodes is 5.
| Worker nodes | The maximum number of worker nodes is 16.
| Replicas per application | The maximum number of replicas per application is 8.
| Replicas per worker node | The maximum number of replicas that can be deployed per worker node is 40.
{sp} +
{sp} +
To allow core sharing across replicas when needed for bursting, run no more than 20-25 *replicas per core*. This ensures the Runtime Fabricâ€™s internal components that run on each worker node are not overloaded by too many replicas.
| Associated environments per Runtime Fabric | The maximum number of environments per Runtime Fabric is 50.
| Business groups | The maximum number of Runtime Fabrics you can create in a business group is 50.
| Object store persistence | To handle data persistence across Mule application replicas and restarts, Anypoint Runtime Fabric uses the Persistence Gateway. See xref:persistence-gateway.adoc[Persistence Gateway].

== Internal Load Balancer Resource Allocation and Performance

The following table lists the approximate number of requests (averaging 10 KB) that can be served with a single replica of the internal load balancer based on the number of CPU cores. This information is based on the performance test results as described in xref:deploy-resource-allocation#internal-load-balancer[Resource Allocation and Performance on Anypoint Runtime Fabric on VMs / Bare Metal].

[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
| vCPU Cores | Max Requests per Second (Connection Reuse) | Max Requests per Second (No Connection Reuse)
| `1.00` | 2000 | 175
| `0.75` | 1500 | 100
| `0.50` | 1000 | 50
| `0.25` | 100 | 10
|===

The internal load balancer runs on the controller nodes of Runtime Fabric on VMs / Bare Metal. Configure the VM size based on the amount and
type of inbound traffic. You can allocate only half of the available CPU cores on each VM to the internal load balancer.
Refer to xref:deploy-resource-allocation#internal-load-balancer[Resource Allocation and Performance on Anypoint Runtime Fabric] for additional information.

== Operating System Limitations

The following table lists known limitations for host operating systems in Runtime Fabric:
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Operating System | Limitation
| RHEL 8 a| 
* Do not set the optional environment variable `disable_selinux` to `false` in the `fabric.tf` script, or installation will fail.
* Do not set SELinux to enforcing mode. 
| RHEL 7 a| 
* If you have enabled SELinux, third-party software running on the host may change policy settings from SELinux.
* You can set SELinux to enforcing mode if you don't change default policies.
| RHEL | Runtime Fabric only supports instances of RHEL with Logical Volume Manager (LVM) on Azure Bare Metal. Non-LVM instances of RHEL on Azure Bare Metal are not supported.
