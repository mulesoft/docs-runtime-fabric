This topic describes how to install Anypoint Runtime Fabric on your AWS account.

[WARNING]
====
Before installing Runtime Fabric, ensure your infrastructure meets the minimum hardware, operating system, and networking requirements.

Your organization's operations, networking and security teams should review these requirements. See xref:install-sys-reqs.adoc[System Requirements for Anypoint Runtime Fabric] and xref:install-port-reqs.adoc[Network and Port Requirements for Anypoint Runtime Fabric].
====

== Before you Begin

Before installing Anypoint Runtime Fabric on AWS, ensure the following requirements have been met:

* You have xref:install-create-rtf-arm.adoc[created a Runtime Fabric in Runtime Manager].
* Your Anypoint Platform user account has the *Manage Runtime Fabrics* permission.
* You are able to run Terraform on your machine.
* Your AWS user has access to create EC2 instances, Disks, VPCs, and Security Groups.
+
See xref:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_testing-policies.html[Testing IAM Policies with the IAM Policy Simulator] for more information.

* Your AWS account has enough quota for the infrastructure required to run Anypoint Runtime Fabric. This includes having the capacity to create an additional VPC, EC2 instances, disks, security group, and other required resources.
* You have the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[AWS key pair] required to provision virtual machines. This key pair is required to enable secure access to your VMs via SSH (Secure Shell).
* You have access to the following AWS-specific environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_ACCESS_SECRET_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`. These are required to run the Terraform script. If you do not know these values, contact your AWS administrator.

== Base64 Encode Your Mule License Key

To install Runtime Fabric, your Mule license key must be Base64 encoded. Locate your organizationâ€™s Mule Enterprise license key file (license.lic) and perform the following according to your operating system.

=== Linux

To encode your license file on Linux, run the following:

----
base64 -w0 license.lic
----

=== MacOS

To encode your license file on MacOS, run the following from the terminal:

----
base64 -b0 license.lic
----

=== Windows

To encode your license file on Windows, a shell terminal emulator (such as cygwin) or access to a Unix-based computer is required to follow these steps:

. Find your organization's Mule Enterprise license key file (`license.lic`) and transfer to your Unix environment if necessary.
. Run the following command to Base64 encode the license key:
+
----
base64 -w0 license.lic
----

== Install Terraform

MuleSoft provides a Terraform script that you run to provision the required AWS resources. You can run the Terrform script in one of the following ways:

* Download and manually install https://terraform.io/[Terraform] on your machine. Verify that the version of Terraform installed is `0.11.7` or later by running `terraform --version` on your terminal.

* Use Terraform within Docker.

== Download the Terraform Script

. Sign in to Anypoint Platform and navigate to Runtime Manager.
. On the left navigation pane, select *Runtime Fabrics*.
. Click the name of your Runtime Fabric. It should be in the Activating state.
. Click *Download files*.
. When the download completes, unzip the `rtf-install-scripts.zip` file.

=== Contents of the Runtime Fabric Installer

Inside the `rtf-install-scripts` folder, there is an `aws` folder containing the following:

* `fabric.tf`: Terraform script that provisions the infrastructure on your AWS account.
* `security_group.tf`: Terraform script containing the Security Groups used by the `fabric.tf` script.
* `installer_env.sh`: shell script of environment variables added to the controller VM acting as a leader during the installation.
* `controller_env.sh`: shell script of environment variables added to the other controller VM(s).
* `worker_env.sh`: shell script of environment variables added to the worker VM(s).
* `README.md`: markdown file containing installation instructions.

=== Modify the fabric.tf Script

Before running Terraform, modify the `fabric.tf` script to reflect your specific environment. The tables below list the required and optional environment variables.

[NOTE]
Depending on your environment, you may need to modify environment variables specified within `fabric.tf` that are not listed in the tables below. This is common if you need to use existing AWS resources such as an existing VPC.

*Required Environment Variables*

[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
|Variable | Description | Example
| `activation_data` | The encoded Runtime Fabric activation data. You can access this data by viewing your Runtime Fabric in Runtime Manager. | `NzdlMzU1YTktMzAxMC00OGE0LWJlMGQtMDdxxxx`
| `key_pair` | The name of the keypair in the AWS region you are deploying to. | `my-keypair`
| `enable_public_ips` | specifies whether the installer creates public IP addresses for each VM. Public IPs enable you to `ssh` directly to the VMs from your network. If this value is set to `false`(default) each VM  only has access to the private network configured by its VPC. If you specify `false`, ensure you have consulted with your network administrator on how to obtain shell/SSH access to VMs. | `true`
| `controllers` | the number of controller VMs to provision. | `3`
| `workers` | the number of worker VMs to provision. | `3`
| `mule_license` | the base64 encoded contents of your organization's Mule Enterprise license key (`license.lic`). |
|===


*Optional Environment Variables*


[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
|Variable | Description | Example
| `service_uid` | An integer representing the user ID to run each Runtime Fabric service. Overrides the default behavior of creating a user named "planet". | `1000`
| `service_gid` | An integer representing the group ID used when running each Runtime Fabric service. Overrides the default behavior of creating a group named "planet". | `900`
| `http_proxy` | A hostname and port for a HTTP proxy server to forward outbound HTTP requests. | `1.1.1.1:80`
| `monitoring_proxy` | A hostname and port, and optional username and password, for a SOCKS5 proxy server to forward metrics and logs to Anypoint Monitoring. | `user:pass@1.1.1.2:800`
| `no_proxy` | A comma-separated list of hosts which should bypass the proxy. | `1.1.1.1,no-proxy.com`
| `existing_vpc_id` | specifies an existing AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Required when installing on an existing VPC. The installer uses this VPC instead of creating a new one. |
| `existing_subnet_ids` | specifies a existing subnet IDs within AWS. Required when installing on an existing network. The installer uses these subnets instead of creating a new one. |
|===

== Configure Your Environment to Access AWS

To run the Terraform script, AWS API access should be configured in your terminal. Define values for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_ACCESS_SECRET_KEY`, and other environment variables including `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, `AWS_REGION`, or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`. These are required to access the AWS API for your account.

To verify that these are set correctly, you should be able to run the `aws-cli` tool, if installed on your machine.

== Run the Terraform Script

After modifying `fabric.tf` to reflect your AWS environment, run the Terraform script to install Runtime Fabric.

=== Terraform State Files

When running, Terraform generates a state file to capture the details of the deployment. In the example below, the state file are located in `tf-data/rtf.tfstate`. A separate state file must be created and maintained for each Runtime Fabric infrastructure creation.

[WARNING]
Keep the state file in a safe place. It is required when making changes to this deployment, such as when scaling the number of worker or controller VMs.

=== Run Using Native Terraform

. Navigate to the `../rtf-install-scripts/aws/` directory. You must run terraform from this directory.
. Initialize terraform (this only has to be performed once):
+
----
terraform init
----

. Copy the following script to a text editor:
+
----
terraform apply \
  -var activation_data='' \
  -var key_pair='' \
  -var enable_public_ips='' \
  -var controllers='3' \
  -var workers='3' \
  -var mule_license='' \
  -state=tf-data/rtf.tfstate
----
+
. Modify this using the data in the environment variables tables above.
. Ensure your terminal has access to the AWS-specific environment variables required as described above.
+
If you experience an error related to AWS authorization, ensure you're using the same terminal window for verifying the variables and running the Terraform command.

. Run the script.

The Terraform script provisions the infrastructure and runs the installation script on each VM. When complete, the Runtime Fabric update to Active status in Runtime Manager.

[NOTE]
This step installs Runtime Fabric across all servers to form a cluster. It may take 15-25 minutes or longer to complete.


==== Run using Docker

. Navigate to the `../rtf-install-scripts/aws/` directory. You must run terraform from this directory.
. Verify your current directory is the unzipped directory. When running the `dir` command, you should see the `aws` directory listed, along with other directories (`azure`, `manual`, etc).
. Initialize terraform (this only has to be performed once):
+
----
docker run -v $(pwd):/src -w /src/aws \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY -e AWS_SESSION_TOKEN \
  hashicorp/terraform:0.11.7 init
----

. Copy the following to a text editor:
+
----
  -var activation_data='' \
  -var key_pair='' \
  -var enable_public_ips='' \
  -var controllers='3' \
  -var workers='3' \
  -var mule_license='' \
  -state=tf-data/rtf.tfstate
----

. Modify this using the data in the environment variables tables above.
. Run the Terraform script:
----
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/src -w /src/aws \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY -e AWS_SESSION_TOKEN \
  hashicorp/terraform:0.11.7 apply \
  -var activation_data='' \
  -var key_pair='' \
  -var enable_public_ips='' \
  -var controllers='3' \
  -var workers='3' \
  -var mule_license='' \
  -state=tf-data/rtf.tfstate
----

The Terraform script provisions the infrastructure and runs the installation script on each VM. When complete, the Runtime Fabric updates to Active status in Runtime Manager.

[NOTE]
This step installs Runtime Fabric across all servers to form a cluster. It may take 15-25 minutes or longer to complete.

== Monitoring Installation Progress

To view the progress during the installation, tail the output log on each VM:

. Open a shell (or SSH session) to the first controller VM.
. Tail the output log, located at `/var/log/rtf-init.log` using the following command:
+
----
tail -f /var/log/rtf-init.log
----

[NOTE]
You can tail the same log on each VM to view its progress.

When the installation completes successfully, the installer creates the `/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric/.state/init-complete` file.

== Access Ops Center

After installation is completed successfully, login to Ops Center to view the status of your Runtime Fabric infrastructure. See xref:using-opscenter.adoc[Using Ops Center on Anypoint Runtime Fabric] for information on accessing Ops Center and determining the Ops Center username and password.
