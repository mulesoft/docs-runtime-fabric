= Manage Proxies on Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes

[IMPORTANT]
====
The procedures in this topic should be performed by a MuleSoft organization administrator.
====

Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes uses two types of proxies when running and hosting applications:

* System proxies: include proxies that enable connectivity among Kubernetes cluster services, including the Docker daemon and other internal components. When using Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes you are responsible for configuring and managing system proxies.
* Application proxies: include proxies that enable connectivity to applications running on Runtime Fabric.


== Apply Proxy Values to Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes

Configure a proxy at the runtime level for all the outbound components running in the runtime to use. 

. Run the following command, replacing the placeholder values with the following:
+
----
rtfctl apply http-proxy "http://<user>:<pass>@<10.0.0.1>:<8080>" --no-proxy "<1.1.1.1:8888,2.2.2.2:9999>"
----
+
* *<user>*: the username needed to authenticate to the HTTP proxy.
* *<pass>*: the password needed to authenticate to the HTTP proxy. 
+
[NOTE]
The password must be URL encoded.

* *<10.0.0.1>*: Specifies the IP address or hostname to access the HTTP proxy.
* *<8080>*: Specifies the port on the host where the HTTP proxy is listening for requests.
* *<1.1.1.1:8888,2.2.2.2:9999>*: Specifies the `RTF_NO_PROXY` hosts and ports, delimited by commas.
* (Optional) `--confirm`: Skips manual acknowledgement of the change. If not specified, the `rtfctl apply proxy` command prompts you to confirm the change before continuing.
. To verify the change was successful, run the following command to output the current value of the HTTP proxy:
+
----
rtfctl get http-proxy
----
+
The output should match the value expected.
. To remove the remove the proxy values, run:
+
-----
sudo /opt/anypoint/runtimefabric/rtfctl apply http-proxy '' --no-proxy ''
-----

== Configure a Proxy for the API Manager Agent

To configure a proxy for the API Manager Agent, add the following properties to the :
----
anypoint.platform.proxy_host=hostname
anypoint.platform.proxy_port=port
anypoint.platform.proxy_username=username
anypoint.platform.proxy_password=password
----

== Configure a Proxy for an Application

Applications deployed in Runtime Fabric do not inherit proxy settings from the Runtime Fabric 
cluster. You must configure a proxy for each application. 

You can set up a proxy on each connector (such as an HTTP requestor) or set up a proxy with application properties as shown in the following example. Setting up a proxy with application properties is less work if you have a large number of connectors in an application.
----
http.nonProxyHosts=localhost|*.svc.cluster.local|*.monitoring.svc.cluster.local
http.proxyHost=172.19.0.23
http.proxyPort=3128
https.proxyHost=172.19.0.23
https.proxyPort=3128

java.net.useSystemProxies=false
com.ning.http.client.AsyncHttpClientConfig.useProxySelector=false
com.ning.http.client.AsyncHttpClientConfig.useProxyProperties=true
