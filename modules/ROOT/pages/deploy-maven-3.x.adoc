= Deploy an Application to Runtime Fabric using Maven (Mule 3.x)

Runtime Fabric supports using Maven to manage and deploy Mule applications using Maven. The information 
in this topic is specific to deploying an application to Mule runtime, version 3.x.

[NOTE]
To deploy an application to Runtime Fabric, the application must be published in Exchange. 
You can use Studio, as describe in  xref:studio::export-to-exchange-task.adoc[Publishing a Project to Exchange]. 
Alternatively, use the Mule Maven Plugin. See 
xref:exchange::to-publish-assets-maven.adoc[Publish and Deploy Exchange Assets Using Maven] for more information.

== Prerequisites

Before using Maven to deploy a Mule application, you should be familiar with Maven, managing pom.xml files, 
and working with Maven plugins.

Before deploying an application to Runtime Fabric you should understand the number of resource it requires. 
See xref:runtime-fabric::deploy-resource-allocation.adoc[Resource Allocation on Anypoint Runtime Fabric] 
for more information.

== Add the Mule Maven Plugin to a Mule Project

To deploy a Mule application using Maven, you must add the Mule Maven Plugin to the application project. 
Add the plugin to you project by adding the following dependency:

----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.mule.tools.maven</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>2.3.2</version>
  <extensions>true</extensions>
</plugin>
----

[NOTE]
It is important to enable extensions for this plugin using `<extensions>true</extensions>`

In addition to the plugin, you must also add `pluginRepositories` to your Mule application project:

----
<pluginRepositories>
    <pluginRepository>
        <id>mule-public</id>
        <url>https://repository.mulesoft.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases</url>
    </pluginRepository>
</pluginRepositories>
----

This enables the Mule Maven Plugin in your project.

== Deploying to Runtime Fabric

. Ensure the Mule Maven Plugin is added to your pom.xml file.
. In the `<plugin>` element, add a configuration for your Runtime Fabric deployment as shown below:
+
----
<plugin>
  ...
    <configuration>
        <runtimeFabricDeployment>
            <uri>https://anypoint.mulesoft.com</uri>
            <muleVersion>${mule.version}</muleVersion>
            <username>${username}</username>
            <password>${password}</password>
            <applicationName>${runtime.fabric.application.name}</applicationName>
            <environment>${environment}</environment>
            <provider>${provider}</provider>
            <properties>
                <key>value</key>
            </properties>
            <deploymentSettings>
                <cpuReserved>500m</cpuReserved>
                <memoryReserved>800Mi</memoryReserved>
            </deploymentSettings>
        </runtimeFabricDeployment>
    </configuration>

</plugin>
----
+
This example uses placeholder values. Configure each value with values specific to your Runtime Fabric installation.

. From the command line in your project's folder, package the application and run the deploy goal:
+
----
> mvn clean package deploy -DmuleDeploy
----

== Redeploy to Runtime Fabric

To redeploy the application, run the same command as you did to deploy. Runtime Fabric rewrites the 
application you previously deployed.

== Runtime Fabric Deployment Reference

[%header%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a"]
|===
|Parameter | Description
|runtimeFabricDeployment | Specifies a top-level element.
| uri | Specifies your Anypoint Platform URI. +
If not set, the default value is `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com+`.
| muleVersion | Specifies the Mule runtime version installed in your Runtime Fabric instance. +
Ensure that this value is at equal or higher than the minimum required Mule runtime version of your application.
| username | Specifies your Anypoint Platform username.
| password | Specifies your Anypoint Platform password.
| applicationName | Specifies the name of your application deployed in Exchange. +
This name is part of the domain of your deployed app.
| businessGroup (optional) | Specifies the business group where you want to deploy the application. If not defined, the name of the master organization is used as the default.
| skip | (boolean value) When set to true, skips the plugin deployment goal. The default value is `false`.
| target | Specifies the Runtime Fabric target name where the applicateion is deployed.
| provider | Specifies the rovider type. The only supported value for Runtime Fabric is `MC`.
| environment |Specifies the Anypoint Platform environment where you want to deploy your application.
| properties (optional) | Specifies a top-level element. +
To set properties for your Mule application, use the <properties> element:


<properties> +
  <key>value</key> +
</properties>


For example:

<properties> +
  <http.port>8081</http.port> +
</properties>
| replicationFactor (optional) | Specifies the number of instances created for your application. +
The default value is `1`
| publicUrl (optional) | Specifies the URL of the deployed application.
| lastMileSecurity (optional) | Enables Last-Mile security to forward HTTPS connections to be decrypted by this application. +
This requires an SSL certificate to be included in the Mule application and also requires more CPU resources. 
The default value is `false`.
| clusteringEnabled (optional) | Enables Mule clustering across each replica of the application. 
You must have at least two replicas of your application. The default value is `false`.
| memoryReserved (optional) | Defines the amount of memory allocated for each replica of the application. 
The default value is `700MB`. 

For example:

<deploymentSettings> +
    <memoryReserved>100Mi</memoryReserved> + 
</deploymentSettings> +

This will set 100MB of memory to each replica.

| cpuReserved (optional) | Specifies the number of cores to be allocated for each replica of the application. 
The default value is `0.5 vCores`. 

The following example specifies 0.5 vCores for each replica:

<deploymentSettings> +
    <cpuReserved>500m</cpuReserved> +
</deploymentSettings> +

| server (optional) | Specifies the Maven server that contains Anypoint Platform credentials. This is property is only required if you want to use the credentials stored in your Maven `settings.xml` file. Note: This is not the Mule server name.
| skipDeploymentVerification | Note: This feature is only available in plugin version 2.3.2 and later. +
(boolean value). When set to true, skips the status verification of your deployed app. The default value is `false`.
