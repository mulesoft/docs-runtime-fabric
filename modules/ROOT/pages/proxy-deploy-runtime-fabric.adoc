Runtime Fabric enables you to deploy API proxies to a Mule runtime.

== Before you Begin

To deploy API proxies to a Mule runtime, you must have the following permissions on your account:

* Manage APIs Configuration permission
* Deploy API Proxies permission

You must ensure that you are using API Gateway version 3.8.7, 3.9.1, or 4.1.2.

== Procedure

. From Anypoint Platform, select API Manager.
. Click *Manage API*, then click *Manage API From Exchange*

. Under *API Configurations*, enter the appropriate information.

. Ensure that you select *Runtime Fabric* under *Proxy deployment target* .

. Click *Save*
+
Under *Deployment Configuration* section configure the following:
+
* Select the *Runtime Fabric target*.
* Select the *Runtime version*.
** Enter the name of the proxy

By default, the resources allocated to the proxy app are:

* CPU: 0.2 vCores
* Memory: 1.024 GB

You can update resource allocation settings on the application's *Settings* page in Runtime Manager.

== Result

API Manager deploys the API proxy to Runtime Fabric. While deploying, a deployment status dialog appears similar to the following:

After deployment, you can manage the deployed API proxy from Runtime Manager.

== Enable an HTTPS Proxy
To enable the proxy to support HTTPs requests:

. Download the API gateway and deploy from API Manager using the instructions in xref:api-manager::download-proxy-task.adoc[Downloading an API Proxy].
. Open the gateway in Anypoint Studio and insert a keystore (SSL cert) using the instructions in xref:mule-runtime::tls-configuration#use-anypoint-studio-to-configure-tls[Use Anypoint Studio to Configure TLS].
. Export and deploy the gateway using Runtime Manager according to the instructions in xref:runtime-fabric::deploy-to-runtime-fabric.adoc[Deploy a Mule Application to Runtime Fabric].
. Enable last-mile security on the application using the instructions in https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/How-to-enable-last-mile-security-in-Runtime-Fabric-RTF[How to enable last-mile security in Runtime Fabric (RTF)].
