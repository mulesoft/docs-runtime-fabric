= Enabling FIPs 140-2 on Mule Applications


You can configure Runtime Fabric to run application containers in FIPS 140-2 compliance mode.

These instructions assume that you are familiar with https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/140/2/final/documents/fips1402.pdf[FIPS 140-2^], the US government security standard that requires that compliant parties use only cryptographic algorithms and techniques that have been certified by NIST.

== Enable FIPS 140-2 Compliance Mode

. Using `kubectl`, patch the `custom-properties` secret in the `rtf` namespace by setting the `FIPS_ENABLED` key to `true`:
+
[source,copy]
----
# kubectl patch secret custom-properties -n rtf -p='{"stringData":{"FIPS_ENABLED": "true"}}'
----
+
After making this change, when you deploy new applications or restart existing applications, their containers run in FIPS 140-2 compliance mode. 

. To verify an application is running in FIPS 140-2 compliance mode, review the application’s startup log:
+
[source,copy]
----
# kubectl logs <app-pod-name> -n <env-id> -c app -f| grep -i fips

Running in FIPS mode
* Security model: fips140-2                                          *
*  - mule.security.model = fips140-2
