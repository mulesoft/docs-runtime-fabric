The following information is important when installing, configuring, and managing Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes.

[cols="2*a"]
.Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes resource allocation 
|===
| Nodes | The maximum number of nodes is 30.
| Node types | VM-based nodes are required. For example, Fargate is not supported.
| Replicas per application | The maximum number of replicas per application is 8.
| Replicas per node | The maximum number of replicas that can be deployed per node is 40.

Run no more than 20 - 25 replicas per core, up to a maximum of 40 replicas per node, to allow core sharing across replicas when needed for bursting. This ensures the Runtime Fabricâ€™s internal components that run on each worker node are not overloaded by too many replicas.
| Associated environments per Runtime Fabric | You can associate a Runtime Fabric with up to 100 environments in any Business Group. For example, if you associate a development and a production environment with Org A and a dev environment with Org B, that is three environment associations. 
| Business groups | You can create up to 50 Runtime Fabrics per org in a Business Group. Any sub org can contain up to 50 Runtime Fabrics, in addition to any shared by another sub org. For example, if you have master Org A and its child Org B, you can have 50 Runtime Fabrics in Org A and 50 in Org B. You can also share all 50 Runtime Fabrics from Org A with Org B, and as a result, you will see 100 Runtime Fabrics in total in the list view of Org B.
| Object store persistence | To manage data persistence across Mule application replicas and restarts, Anypoint Runtime Fabric uses Persistence Gateway. See xref:persistence-gateway.adoc[Persistence Gateway].
