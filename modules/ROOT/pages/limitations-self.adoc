[cols="2*a"]
.Anypoint Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes resource allocation 
|===
| Nodes | The maximum number of nodes supported is 30.
| Node Types | VM-based nodes are required. For example, Fargate is not supported.
| Replicas Per Node | The maximum number of replicas that can be deployed per node is 40.

Run no more than 20 - 25 replicas per core, up to a maximum of 40 replicas per node, to allow core sharing across replicas when needed for bursting. This ensures the Runtime Fabricâ€™s internal components that run on each worker node are not overloaded by too many replicas.
| Associated Environments per Runtime Fabric | The maximum number of environments per Runtime Fabric is 50. 
| Business Groups | The maximum number of Runtime Fabrics you can create in a business group is 50.
| Object Store Persistence | To manage data persistence across Mule application replicas and restarts, Anypoint Runtime Fabric uses Persistence Gateway. See xref:persistence-gateway.adoc[Persistence Gateway].
