[IMPORTANT]
====
This content refers to configuring ingress on Runtime Fabric for versions 1.10 and later. Refer to the documentation for versions 1.8 or 1.9 for previous ingress configuration instructions.
==== 

Anypoint Runtime Fabric enables you to specify custom Ingress configurations using an ingress resource template. In a template, similar to a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/[Kubernetes ingress spec^], you can specify annotations, ingress class name, and HTTP and HTTPS rules. 

If you do not apply an ingress resource template for an application, you canâ€™t add ingress endpoints when you deploy it.  

[IMPORTANT]
====
The ingress controller included with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provisions a separate HTTP load balancer per application by default. Refer to https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/Default-Ingress-Controller-Behavior-with-Runtime-Fabric-on-GKE[Default Ingress Controller Behavior with Runtime Fabric on GKE^] for more information.

AWS Application Load Balancers have similar behavior unless you use the `group.name` annotation. Refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/alb-ingress.html[Application load balancing on Amazon EKS^] for details. 
====

== Benefits of Custom Ingress Resource Templates

Using custom ingress resource templates in Runtime Fabric enables you to take advantage of native Kubernetes ingress configuration functionality, including support for: 

* Multiple ingress configurations per application
* Multiple ingress controllers within the same Runtime Fabric instance
* TLS and HTTPS configuration
* Custom URL naming
* URL parameter placeholders

== How Ingress Resources Templates Work in Runtime Fabric

The following diagram provides an overview of how to use ingress resource templates in Runtime Fabric:

image::ingress-diagram.png[Diagram shows the ingress template workflow in Runtime Fabric,80%]

. An IT admin configures an ingress controller. 
. An IT admin creates or modifies an ingress resource template using the necessary parameters. Various ingress controllers operate differently. Review your ingress controller documentation and adjust your annotations accordingly. 
. An IT admin applies the template using `kubectl apply` commands.
. From the applied template, Runtime Fabric creates placeholder URI domains and propagates the ingress configuration in Anypoint Runtime Manager as a template for all application deployments.
. A Mule application developer uses Runtime Manager to configure an application for deployment by selecting an available host, an optional subdomain, and a path combination, as specified in the ingress template. 
. Runtime Fabric receives the application deployment request and uses the ingress configurations from the template to create a corresponding ingress object in the cluster.

== Example Ingress Resource Templates

The following examples illustrate how to modify a Kubernetes ingress spec to create a Runtime Fabric ingress-resource template. 

Use the API version appropriate to your Kubernetes version:

* Kubernetes v1.19 or later: 
** networking.k8s.io/v1 
** networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
+
For Kubernetes v1.22 and later, the `extensions/v1beta1` and `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` API versions of Ingress are not available.
* Kubernetes v1.18 and earlier: 
** only networking.k8s.io/v1beta1  

=== networking.k8s.io/v1

[NOTE]
====
This template is a simplified version of the configuration. The final configuration of the template can vary depending on the controller and ingress routing rules you use. Review the documentation for your ingress controller carefully.

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: example-rtf-ingress
  namespace: rtf #<1>                           
  labels:
spec:
  ingressClassName: rtf-nginx #<2> 
  tls: #<3>
  - hosts:
      - app-name.example.com
    secretName: example-tls
  rules:
  - host: app-name.example.com #<4>
    http:
      paths: #<5>
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: / #<6>
        backend: #<7>
          service:
            name: service-name
            port:
              name: service-port
--

Note the following about this example:
  
<1> The template must be placed in the `rtf` namespace.

<2> ingressClassName must be prefixed with `rtf-`, for example, `rtf-nginx`.
+
Runtime Fabric uses the `rtf-` prefix to recognize the object as a template.
Templates with `rtf-` prefix in the `spec.ingressClassName` field or in the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation
are consumed by the Runtime Fabric agent only and not by the actual ingress controller.
Ingress controllers discover only those resources with a `spec.ingressClassName` value that use the vendor-specific name, for example, `nginx` or `haproxy`.

<3> TLS is optional.
+
If you add the TLS section with a `secretName` attribute, you must ensure that you also create the referred TLS secret in the `rtf` namespace.

<4> The `app-name` placeholder parameter is replaced with the actual app name when you deploy the application. It helps to ensure that each endpoint name is unique if there is not a wildcard in the subdomain.

<5> A template can include multiple paths for a host, but Runtime Manager displays only the first path rule for the host.

<6> The `path` parameter value is replaced by the value you add in the *Path* field when you xref:configure-ingress-for-a-mule-application[configure ingress for a Mule application]. Note that `path` is not a placeholder. 

<7> These placeholder values are required for Kubernetes validation, but the actual values are not used by Runtime Fabric. 

For a path-based routing ingress template, consult your ingress controller documentation and configure it accordingly. For an example using Nginx, see https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/Path-based-Nginx-Ingress-Routing-Example-for-Runtime-Fabric-on-Self-Managed-Kubernetes[Path-based Nginx Ingress Routing Example for Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes].

<1> The template must be placed in the `rtf` namespace.

<2> ingressClassName must be prefixed with `rtf-`, for example, `rtf-nginx`.

Runtime Fabric uses the `rtf-` prefix to recognize the object as a template.

=== Template Placeholders 

The following placeholders are optional. If you use a placeholder, replace it in the appropriate location in the template. Placeholders must be lowercase.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name of Placeholder |Location |Example Value 
|`business-group-id` |`path`, `host`, `annotation, labels` a|

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
  business: 
  business-group-id
----

|`environment-id` |`path`, `host`, `annotation, labels` a|

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
  environment: 
  environment-id
----
|`unique-id` | `path`, `annotation, labels` a| 

[source,yaml]
----
path: /app-name-unique-id.com
----
|===

Use the `unique-id` placeholder to create a unique application URL. This is useful if you want to deploy two applications with same name from different business groups. For example, if you use `app-name-unique-id.com` in the `path` section of the ingress template, the resulting endpoint will be similar to `app-name-7jkbic.com`.

[NOTE]
--
The `unique-id` placeholder is available in Runtime Fabric version 1.12.28 and later.
--

== Using TLS in the Ingress Template

To use TLS in the ingress template, you must create a TLS secret. See the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls[Kubernetes TLS documentation^] for details. 

You can use the `rtf.mulesoft.com/synchronized=true` label to configure Runtime Fabric to synchronize any TLS secret updates to all application namespaces, for example: 

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: testsecret-tls
  namespace: default
  labels:
    rtf.mulesoft.com/synchronized=true
data:
  tls.crt: base64 encoded cert
  tls.key: base64 encoded key
type: kubernetes.io/tls
```

Applying this label to your secret enables your ingress controller to immediately apply the updated TLS material into application namespaces. If you don't add this label, you must manually update the secret in each namespace.

== Modify an Existing Ingress Template

You can modify existing ingress templates even if they were already used for application deployments.
Note that already created ingress objects based on this template are not updated if you modify the template.

To update existing ingresses with the template changes, you have to perform a redeployment of the Mule application.
For example, if you update the base domain which requires to change the endpoint for the ingress template, you must remove the old endpoint and add the new one as part of the application redeployment.

== Configure Ingress for a Mule Application Deployment in Runtime Fabric

To configure ingress, complete the following tasks:

. Create an ingress resource template and apply it in the cluster.
. Configure ingress for a Mule application.

=== Before You Begin

Before configuring ingress in Runtime Fabric, you must set up an ingress controller. See the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/[Kubernetes documentation^] for a list of ingress controllers. 

=== Create an Ingress Resource Template and Apply it in the Cluster

Use one of the xref:example-ingress-resource-templates[example templates] to create an ingress resource. 

include::partial$include-ingress-tasks.adoc[tags=createTemplate]

=== Configure Ingress for a Mule Application  

include::partial$include-ingress-tasks.adoc[tags=configureIngressRuntimeManager]

== Existing Ingress Configurations Translated Post-Upgrade 

When upgrading to Runtime Fabric version 1.10, the upgrade process automatically translates any existing ingress ConfigMaps to the ingress resource template format, including annotations, path, namespace, and host parameters. Review the following table to determine if any action is required after upgrading.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Runtime Fabric Pre-upgrade |Runtime Fabric Upgraded |Action Required |TLS Support
|No domains configured and no ingress-ConfigMap applied |No template is generated automatically after the upgrade|Create a template. See <<Create an Ingress Resource Template and Apply it in the Cluster>>.  |-
|No domains configured, but a valid ingress-ConfigMap applied |Generated template will contain `*` for hosts and will contain the path and annotations from the previous ingress-ConfigMap |Edit the `host` field in the generated template to provide a valid host/domain for deploying applications in Runtime Manager | No TLS section added by default
|Valid domains configured, but no ingress-ConfigMap applied |Generated templates will contain one host per domain per template and will include `/app-name` in the path for each template |No immediate action is required unless the domains use `https://`; in this case, configure a TLS secret in the template corresponding to the  HTTPS domain |For domains that have `https://`, the template corresponding to that domain will have a TLS section without a secret attribute
|Valid domains configured and a valid ingress-ConfigMap applied |Generated templates will contain one host per domain per template and will include all the paths and annotations from the previous ingress-ConfigMap |No immediate action required, unless the domains use `https://`; in this case, configure a TLS secret in the template corresponding to the HTTPS domain |For domains that have `https://`, the template corresponding to that domain will have a TLS section without a secret attribute

== Troubleshooting Ingress Issues

If you encounter errors when attempting to use ingress for Runtime Fabric, troubleshoot them as follows.

=== Mule App Deployed But Cannot Access Its Endpoint

Scenario: You successfully deploy a Mule application in Runtime Manager, but you cannot access the applicationâ€™s endpoint.

To troubleshoot this issue: 

. Verify that the application is listening on port 8081:
+
[source,copy]
--
kubectl port-forward -n [NAMESPACE] svc/<APP_NAME> 8081:8081 
--

. Verify that the application is running and responding to HTTP requests:
+
[source,copy]
--
curl -v \http://127.0.0.1:8081/
--
+
This helps determine if the API access issue is on the Mule app itself.  

. Validate that an ingress resource exists for that application service: 
+
[source,copy]
--
kubectl get ingress -n [NAMESPACE]
--

. Validate that the service was created:
+
[source,copy]
--
kubectl get svc -n [NAMESPACE]
--

If not, check the Runtime Fabric agent logs:
+
[source,copy]
--
kubectl logs -n rtf [AGENT_POD_NAME] -f
--

If the service and ingress object look healthy, see additional troubleshooting tasks. 

=== Ingress Resource Created in Cluster But Cannot Access Its Endpoint

Scenario: Runtime Fabric successfully creates an ingress resource in the cluster but you cannot access the applicationâ€™s endpoint due to a 404 error. 

To troubleshoot this issue: 

. Verify the ingress and service resources:
+
[source,copy]
----
kubectl get ingress -n<APP-NAMESPACE>
kubectl get svc -n<APP-NAMESPACE>
----
+
The results should be similar to:
+
----
# kubectl get ingress -n<APP-NAMESPACE>                             
NAME                           CLASS       HOSTS               ADDRESS       PORTS     AGE
<INGRESS_RESOURCE>            <INGRESS>    <HOSTNAME>.com      <HOST IP>     80, 443   7m3s

# kubectl get svc -n<APP-NAMESPACE>                                
NAME             TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
<SERVICE-NAME>       ClusterIP   <CLUSTER IP>   <none>        8081/TCP,8082/TCP,5701/TCP   8m5s
----

. Check the ingress resource for your app to ensure that the HTTP path in the resource, annotations, and host are correctly rendered:
+
[source,copy]
--
kubectl get ing -n<APP-NAMESPACE> <INGRESS-RESOURCE-NAME> -oyaml
--
+
The results should be similar to:
+
[source,yaml]
--
# kubectl get ing -n<APP-NAMESPACE> <INGRESS-RESOURCE-NAME> -oyaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  labels:
    ingress.rtf.mulesoft.com/svcName: <APP_NAME>
    ingress.rtf.mulesoft.com/svcVersion: <UUID>
â€¦
â€¦
spec:
  ingressClassName: <INGRESS-CLASS>
  rules:
  - host: myapp.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: myapp
          servicePort: 8081
        path: /
        pathType: Prefix
  tls:
  - hosts: myapp.example.com
    secretName: example-tls
status:
  loadBalancer:
    ingress:
    - hostname: <hostname>
--

. Check the application pod logs to ensure that youâ€™ve configured the correct listening port:
+
[source,copy]
--
kubectl logs -f -n<APP-NAMESPACE> <APP-POD-NAME> -c app
--
+
The results should be similar to:
+

. In the logs, verify that the listener port matches the service port discovered in Step 1.
. If the port is correct, check the application logs to verify that the application is receiving requests from the ingress controller.

=== Ingress Resource Not Recognized by AWS Application Load Balancer

Scenario: When using an AWS ALB, you canâ€™t access an applicationâ€™s endpoint, even though you successfully deployed the application and endpoint. 

If youâ€™re using AWS Load Balancer Controller for ingress, you must specify the `kubernetes.io/ingress.class: rtf-alb` annotation in the template, _not_ `ingressClassName: rtf-alb`. AWS Load Balancer Controller requires the `ingress.class` annotation to discover and create L7 load balancers for deployed ingress resources for those annotations.
