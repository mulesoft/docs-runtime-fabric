= Managing Mule Runtime Patch Updates for Apps on Runtime Fabric

The following provides important information about Mule runtime engine patch updates and the Mule runtime engine release channels for Anypoint Runtime Fabric.

For a list of patch updates, refer to xref:release-notes::runtime-fabric/runtime-fabric-runtimes-release-notes.adoc[Mule runtime patch updates for Runtime Fabric].

== Version Rewrite

Version rewrite used to override the build tag specified in a deployment request if the build tag was out of support or invalid. Starting October 3, 2023, version rewrite does not override any specified tags for any version. However, if a Mule app is deployed through the API without a build tag, the latest build is auto-selected.

== Monthly Date-Patch Updates 

Once per month, MuleSoft releases a _date-patch update_, which includes backward-compatible bug fixes to address any issues discovered in Mule runtime engine.
The monthly date-patch update might include security patches if the scheduled date is within the security SLA.

The format of the version number for these updates is:

_Major_._Minor_._Patch_ - _Date_ 

<<mule-runtime-version,Mule Runtime Version Naming Changes>>

Here's an example version number, including the patch date:

`4.3.0:20210101`

The monthly patches update applications only to the latest date-patch. They do not change the runtime version.

=== Mule Runtime Patch Updates for Runtime Fabric Schedule 

Runtime Fabric runs each application and gateway deployment on a separate Mule runtime instance. By managing the containerized Mule images used for these deployments, Runtime Fabric enables you to upgrade your Mule runtime version for each deployment on the following schedule:

. On the first full week of the month, you have access to new date-patches of updated Mule runtime instances.
. During the next two weeks, you can redeploy your applications using the newer date-patch to validate its behavior. This is known as a _grace period_.
. Beginning on the third full week of the month, you must select the latest date-patch of your chosen Mule runtime version when deploying a new application, or when making a change to an existing application.

[Note]
Starting with Mule runtime engine version 4.5, you can disable autoupgrades of your Mule apps on redeployment by passing the tag required for version pinning.

During the grace period, you can select earlier date-patch versions until they are no longer available through the Runtime Manager UI but still usable through the API. Note that this behavior changes starting with Mule runtime engine version 4.5 with Edge and LTS channel releases. All build tags are available in the Runtime Manager UI and API.

=== Update a Single App to the Latest Runtime Patch Release

Before updating apps in the production environment, update them in the sandbox environment and run required tests. 

To update an app to the latest date patch:

. In the Runtime Manager navigation menu, click *Applications*.
. Under *Deployment Target*, from the *Runtime version* list, select the version tagged `new`:
+

Although the version number of the update might be the same as the installed version, a later date identifies the update:
+
image::rtf-runtime-select-latest-version.png[The latest runtime version indicated by the date]
. If you want to see details about the version, click the *Read release notes* link.
. Click *Apply Changes* to update the app. 
+
Runtime Fabric updates the app with the version you selected and displays a message indicating success or failure.
. Redeploy your application.
+
Mule deployments on Runtime Fabric are not automatically patched. You must redeploy your applications to apply the latest date-patch updates.

After you select the option *Use Edge Release Channel* in the Runtime Manager UI, the platform shows all the build tags for Edge and LTS channels. The build tag is specific to Runtime Manager and CloudHub 2.0 because the image can be built multiple times for a given Mule runtime version. 
The Runtime Manager UI does not show build tags for Mule runtime engine versions < 4.5 but you can still use any build through the API.
