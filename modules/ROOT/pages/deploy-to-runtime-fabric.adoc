You deploy Mule applications to Mule runtime servers on Anypoint Runtime Fabric. 

Applications deployed to a production environment must be deployed to an instance of Runtime Fabric that is separate from non-production applications.

After deploying an application you can test the inbound traffic for deployed applications.

== Deploy a Mule Application to Runtime Fabric

The full deployment process includes these steps:

. Select the application and deployment target
. Configure the deployment target
. Configure a public endpoint for the application 
. Set up replication
. (Optional) Enable TLSv1 and TLSv1.1
. Configure application properties
. Deploy the application

=== Prerequisites

Before deploying an application to Anypoint Runtime Fabric, perform the following:

* Review the xref:index.adoc#anypoint-platform-roles-and-permissions[Anypoint Platform Roles and Permissions] necessary for deploying applications to Runtime Fabric. 
* Ensure that Runtime Fabric is associated with an environment. Refer to xref:associate-environments.adoc[Associating Business Groups and Environments to Anypoint Runtime Fabric]
* Determine the resource allocation requirements for your application. Refer to xref:deploy-resource-allocation-self-managed.adoc[Determine Application Resource Allocation on Runtime Fabric] for more information.
* To deploy an application to a specific domain (endpoint), ensure that you have set up domains (endpoints) in your environment. Refer to xref:custom-ingress-configuration.adoc[Configure Ingress For Runtime Fabric].
* If you're using Runtime Fabric on Red Hat OpenShift, follow the steps in xref:install-openshift.adoc#prepare-for-deploying-mule-apps-to-red-hat-openshift[Prepare for Deploying Mule Apps to Red Hat OpenShift] to enable app deployment.

=== Select the Application and Deployment Target

. Sign into https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform].
. Navigate to *Runtime Manager*, and select *Applications*.
. Click *Deploy application*.
. Provide a name for your application in the *Application Name* field.
+
The name can contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.
. Click *Choose File* to select the application to deploy, and then select one of the following options:
+
* *Import file from Exchange*: Select a Mule application stored in Anypoint Exchange.
* *Upload file*: Select a Mule application file from your filesystem.
+
. From the *Deployment Target* drop-down list, select the name of your Runtime Fabric.
. Select the Mule runtime engine version from the *Runtime Version* drop-down list.
+

The *Deployment Target*, *Ingress*, *Properties*, *Logs*, and *JVM* tabs are displayed. Use these tabs to enter additional configuration information for your application.

=== Configure a Public Endpoint for the Application 

Use the following steps to configure a public endpoint for an application deployed to Runtime Fabric.

Available domains and paths for an application come from the ingress resource template configured by your Runtime Fabric administrator. Refer to xref:custom-ingress-configuration.adoc[Use Custom Ingress Resource Templates in Runtime Fabric] for more information. 

[NOTE]
If you do not select a domain, the application is deployed to an empty domain.

. Select *Ingress*.
. From the *Host* drop-down list, select a host for the application.
. If the hostname uses a wildcard, add a subdomain in the *Subdomain* field. 
+
The *Subdomain* field is only available if the hostname uses a wildcard.
. In the *Path* field, add a URL path to the application’s endpoint:
+
image::rtf-ingress-endpoint.png[A host and path are set for the application's endpoint]

. To preview the endpoint, click the generated preview link.
. To add additional endpoints, click *+ Add Endpoint*.

=== Set Up Replication and Storage

After you configure an application's endpoints, set up replication to configure the number of application instances to deploy. 

A minimum of two replicas is required for high availability.

You set up object to storage to enable data persistence across Mule application replicas and restarts.
This option is only available on Mule runtime engine version 4.2.1 or later. If this option is unavailable, contact your IT administrator. Refer to xref:persistence-gateway.adoc[Persistence Gateway] for more information.

. Select the *Deployment Target* tab.
+
This tab displays the name and type of the deployment target previously selected.
. Select the number of replicas, or instances, of the application to deploy.
. To enable Mule clustering across each replica of the application, enable *Run in Runtime Clustering Mode*.
. To enforce the deployment of replicas across different nodes, select *Enforce deploying replicas across nodes*.
+
[WARNING]
====
If there is an insufficient number of worker nodes or resources available on the worker nodes needed to deploy each replica, some replicas in the deployment remain in *Pending* status. The deployment status will transition to *Running* after all replicas are deployed on different worker nodes.
====

. To enable data persistence, select *Use Persistent Object Storage*.
. Specify the number of *Cores* and amount of *Memory* to allocate to each replica of the application by adjusting the sliders to the appropriate values.
+
If needed, review xref:deploy-resource-allocation-self-managed.adoc[determine resource allocation] for applications deployed to Runtime Fabric.

=== (Optional) Enable TLS v1 and TLS v1.1

Starting with the xref:release-notes::runtime-fabric/runtime-fabric-runtimes-release-notes.adoc#august-3-2021[August 3, 2021 patch releases], Mule runtime disables TLS v1 and TLS v1.1 by default for all runtime versions. When you deploy an application to Runtime Fabric, you can enable TLS v1 or TLS v1.1 using JVM args.

. Click the *JVM* tab. 
. In the *Java Virtual Machine arguments* field, add one of the following arguments:
* Enable TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1: `-Drtf.allow.TLSv1.0+`
* Enable TLSv1.1: `-Drtf.allow.TLSv1.1`

=== Configure Application Properties

[NOTE]
--
For instructions on protecting application property values, see xref:protect-app-properties.adoc[Protect Application Property Values in Runtime Fabric]
--

Use Runtime Manager to configure any application property values, such as specifying the environment or setting passwords and usernames. 

Runtime Fabric resolves the property at runtime without exposing the sensitive information.

. Click the *Properties* tab.
. Click *Table view*.
. In the *New Key* field, add a property to protect. 
. In the *New Value* field, add a value.
. Add additional properties as needed.

=== Configure Logging and Log Levels

Anypoint Monitoring provides access to log data for applications deployed to Runtime Fabric. To access logs with Anypoint Monitoring, you need a https://www.mulesoft.com/anypoint-pricing[Titanium subscription].

. Click the *Logging* tab.
. Select the *Enable application logs* option.
. Select the log level from the drop-down list:
+
** *INFO*: Informative messages
** *DEBUG*: Debugging messages
** *WARNING*: Warning messages
** *ERROR*: Error messages, such as when an exception occurs
** *FATAL*: Fatal messages for when an application fails
. Optionally, set the log level for specific a Java package class by selecting the log level, entering the `package.name`, and pressing the Enter key.
. Click *Apply Changes*.

=== Deploy the Application

Now you're ready to deploy the application. 

. To deploy the application, click *Deploy Application*.
+
If the *Deploy Application* button is disabled, ensure that you have uploaded a valid Mule application file. Also ensure that the Mule runtime engine version you selected is the same as the version used by your application.

_Result_: Runtime Manager displays a status message confirming the application deployment. After the deployment starts, you'll be directed to the applications list page where you can view the deployment status.

For newly deployed applications, the status initially displays as *Starting*. The status updates to *Started* if the application is successful. Monitor the application status to ensure that it starts successfully.


== Verify Inbound Traffic for Deployed Applications

To test inbound traffic for deployed applications, you can send a request using the controller IP address along with a host header set to the domain. The host header depends on the structure of the application URL.

. Determine which endpoint exposes the application. The *Application url* field on the *Manage application* page in Runtime Manager contains this information.

. Run the following cURL command for verification:
+
[source,copy]
--
curl -Lvk -XGET {application-path-from-runtime-manager} --resolve {hostname}:443:{ip-address-of-controller}
--
+
In the following example, `{application-path-from-runtime-manager}` is set to `https://newapp.example-rtf.dev`, and `192.168.64.14` is the IP address of a controller machine in your cluster.
+
[source,copy]
--
curl -Lvk https://newapp.example-rtf.dev/ --resolve newapp.example-rtf.dev:443:192.168.64.14
--

== Configure Continuous Deployment

To set up a workflow for on-premises application deployment on Runtime Fabric, refer to xref:runtime-manager::continuous-deployment#workflow-for-on-premises-runtime-fabric.adoc[Workflow for On-Premises Runtime Fabric].


== Common Issues

When deploying applications, you may encounter the following issues:

* If your application remains in the *Starting* status for several minutes, this may be due to specifying a lower amount of resources. It's common for applications to take several minutes to start up when selecting 0.3 cores or lower.

* If the application encounters an error during startup, the deployment will stop and the status updates to *Failed*. An error message preview is displayed when clicking on the application and viewing the right sidebar. To view the entire message, click on the *Manage Application* button.

* An error message indicating `insufficient resources` is returned when Runtime Fabric doesn't have the CPU cores or memory available for the deployment. When selecting multiple replicas, it's important to know that the cores and memory specified applies to _each_ replica.

* If a re-deployment to an existing running application fails, the previous application remains running and active. This behavior enables zero-downtime application re-deployments. Runtime Manager will report the details and status of the failed deployment to help resolve the failure.
