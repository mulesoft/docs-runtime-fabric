= Managing Secure Properties with rtfctl
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

Secure properties are added in the Runtime Fabric cluster locally, stored securely, and scoped per environment. Secure properties are accessible in unencrypted form by Mule applications deployed in the scoped environment as custom properties.

Runtime Fabric secure properties always take precedence over application-level properties.

== Install rtfctl 

The `rtfctl` utility is required to manage secure properties on Runtime Fabric locally. Follow the steps to xref:install-rtfctl.adoc[install rtfctl] before continuing with managing secure properties.

== Set Secure Properties

. Log into a controller node where `rtfctl` is installed. 
. Run the following command to set a secure property to the Runtime Fabric under a specific environment, substituting the placeholder fields:
+
----
sudo ./rtfctl apply secure-property --key <my_key> --value <my_value> -n <environment_id>
----
+
* *<my_key>*: The key for the secure property used in the Mule application to reference the value.
* *<my_value>*: The value for the secure property to store.
* *<environment_id>*: The Anypoint environment ID to scope this secure property to. Only applications deployed to this environment will have access to this secure property.

== View Secure Properties

. Log into a controller node where `rtfctl` is installed. 
. Run the following command to view the secure properties applied to the Runtime Fabric under a specific environment, substituting the placeholder fields:
+
----
sudo ./rtfctl get secure-properties -n <environment_id>
----
+
* *<environment_id>*: The Anypoint environment ID to list the secure properties under.

== Access Secure Properties

You can access secure properties from inside your Mule application using `${my.property.name}`.

== Remove Secure Properties

. Log into a controller node where `rtfctl` is installed. 
. Run the following command to remove a secure property from the Runtime Fabric in a specific namespace:
+
----
sudo ./rtfctl delete secure-property <my_key> -n <namespace>
----
+
* *<my_key>*: The key used in the Mule application to reference the secure property.
* *<namespace>*: The namespace in which the secure property applies.
