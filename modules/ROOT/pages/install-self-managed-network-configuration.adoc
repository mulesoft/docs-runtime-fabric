= Configuring Your Network to Support Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes

[IMPORTANT]
====
Network configuration must be performed by an IT administrator.
====

Before installing or using Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes, ensure that the following ports and hostnames are configured correctly.

== Port Configuration

To install or run Runtime Fabric, ensure that you have configured the following ports on your Kubernetes installation:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Port | Layer 4 Protocol | Layer 5 Protocol | Source | Destination | Description
| 443 | TCP | HTTPS | API consumers | All nodes | Allow inbound API requests to ingress controllers
| 443 | TCP | AMQP over WebSockets | All nodes | Internet | Anypoint Platform management services
| 443 | TCP | HTTPS | All nodes | Internet | API Manager policy updates, API Analytics Ingestion, and Resource retrieval (application files, container images).
| 443 (v1.8.50, or later) | TCP | Lumberjack | All nodes | Internet | Anypoint Monitoring, Anypoint Visualizer
| 5044 (deprecated) | TCP | Lumberjack | All nodes | Internet | Anypoint Monitoring, Anypoint Visualizer

*This port and hostname are deprecated in Anypoint Runtime Fabric, version 1.8.50 and later.* 

If you are using a previous version of Anypoint Runtime Fabric you must add this port your allow list. If you are using a newer version, use the port and hostname specified above.
|===

== Port Used by the Persistence Gateway

The Persistent Gateway requires a Postgres-compliant database to store persistent data across Mule application replicas. Ensure that your Kubernetes cluster has access to this database and port. See xref:persistence-gateway.adoc[Persistence Gateway].

== Hostname Configuration

To function correctly, Runtime Fabric on Self-Managed Kubernetes requires the following hostname configurations:

[%header,cols="4*a"]
|===
| Port | Protocol | Hostnames | Description
| 443 | AMQP over WebSockets a| 
* US control plane: `transport-layer.prod.cloudhub.io`
* EU control plane: `transport-layer.prod-eu.msap.io` | Runtime Fabric message broker for interaction with the control plane.
| 443 (v1.8.50, or later)| TCP (Lumberjack) a| 
* US control plane: `dias-ingestor-router.us-east-1.prod.cloudhub.io`
* EU control plane: `dias-ingestor-nginx.prod-eu.msap.io` | Anypoint Monitoring agent for Runtime Fabric.
| 5044 (deprecated) |TCP (Lumberjack) a| 
* US control plane: `dias-ingestor-nginx.prod.cloudhub.io`
* EU control plane: `dias-ingestor-nginx.prod-eu.msap.io` | Anypoint Monitoring agent for Runtime Fabric.

*This port and hostname are deprecated in Anypoint Runtime Fabric, version 1.8.50 and later.* 

If you are using a previous version of Anypoint Runtime Fabric you must add this port and hostname to your allow list. If you are using a newer version, use the port and hostname specified below. This is applicable to endpoints in both the US and EU clouds.
| 443 | HTTPS | `anypoint.mulesoft.com` | Anypoint Platform for pulling assets.
| 443 | HTTPS | `kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com` | Kubernetes base charts repository.
| 443 | HTTPS | `docker-images-prod.s3.amazonaws.com` | Kubernetes base charts repository.
| 443 | HTTPS a| 
* US control plane: `worker-cloud-helm-prod.s3.amazonaws.com`
* EU control plane: `worker-cloud-helm-prod-eu-rt.s3.amazonaws.com`, `worker-cloud-helm-prod-eu-rt.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com` | Runtime Fabric version repository. The Runtime Fabric installation uses software from this repository during installation and upgrades.
| 443 | HTTPS a|
* US control plane: `exchange2-asset-manager-kprod.s3.amazonaws.com`
* EU control plane: `exchange2-asset-manager-kprod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com`, `exchange2-asset-manager-kprod-eu.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com` |Anypoint Exchange for application assets.
| 443 | HTTPS a|
* US control plane: `exchange-files.anypoint.mulesoft.com` 
* EU control plane: `exchange-files.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com` | Anypoint Exchange for application files.
| 443 | HTTPS a| 
* US control plane: `rtf-runtime-registry.kprod.msap.io`
* EU control plane: `rtf-runtime-registry.kprod-eu.msap.io` | Runtime Fabric Docker repository.
| 443 | HTTPS a| 
* US control plane: `prod-us-east-1-starport-layer-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com`, `prod-us-east-1-starport-layer-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
* EU control plane: `prod-eu-central-1-starport-layer-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com`, `prod-eu-central-1-starport-layer-bucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com` | Runtime Fabric Docker image delivery.
| 443 | HTTPS a| 
* US control plane: `runtime-fabric.s3.amazonaws.com`
* EU control plane: `runtime-fabric-eu.s3.amazonaws.com` | Runtime Fabric Docker repository.
| 443 | HTTPS a|
* US control plane: `configuration-resolver.prod.cloudhub.io`
* EU control plane: `configuration-resolver.prod-eu.msap.io` | Anypoint Configuration Resolver.

== Verify Outbound Connectivity

Every Anypoint Runtime Fabric cluster requires connectivity with Anypoint control plane, and any interference with connectivity can limit functionality, resulting in application deployment failures or degraded status in Anypoint Runtime Manager.

You can use `rtfctl` to verify that Runtime Fabric has the required outbound connectivity. On each node, follow the instructions in xref:install-rtfctl.adoc[Install rtfctl] to install `rtfctl`.

To verify the required outbound connectivity, run the following command on all controller and worker nodes in the cluster:

----
sudo ./rtfctl test outbound-network
----

Sample output:

----
[root@rtf-controller-1 runtimefabric]# sudo ./rtfctl test outbound-network
Using proxy configuration from Runtime Fabric (proxy "", no proxy "")

Using 'US' region
transport-layer.prod.cloudhub.io:443 ✔
https://anypoint.mulesoft.com ✔
https://worker-cloud-helm-prod.s3.amazonaws.com ✔
https://exchange2-asset-manager-kprod.s3.amazonaws.com ✔
https://ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com ✔
https://494141260463.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com ✔

https://runtime-fabric.s3.amazonaws.com ✔
tcp://dias-ingestor-nginx.prod.cloudhub.io:443 ✔
----

If you have outbound connectivity issues that prevent Runtime Fabric from reaching any of the required Anypoint control plane services, work with your network team to verify that you have added the required port IPs and hostnames to the allowlist as described in the port configuration section.

== Certificate Configuration

To allow different endpoints to use mutual TLS authentication to establish a connection, you must configure SSL passthrough to allow the following certificates:

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
| Control Plane | Certificates
| US control plane | `transport-layer.prod.cloudhub.io` +
configuration-resolver.prod.cloudhub.io
| EU control plane | `transport-layer.prod-eu.msap.io` +
`configuration-resolver.prod-eu.msap.io`
