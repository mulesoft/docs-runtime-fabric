= Enabling Mule App Deployments Kubernetes Permissions on Runtime Fabric

Mule apps deployed on the Runtime Fabric platform do not access the underlying Kubernetes API server. By default, Mule app deployments do not have RBAC configurations (`Role` and `Rolebindings`).

However, if the Mule app use case requires K8s (Kubernetes) API access, you can override this behavior by enabling the `automountserviceaccounttoken` via customization CRD (custom resource definition) and attach a `Role` (customer-owned) with a `Rolebinding` (customer-owned) to the service account that Runtime Fabric core software creates per deployment. Refer to xref:customize-kubernetes-crd.adoc[].
