= Mutual Authentication with Anypoint Platform
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

With Anypoint Runtime Fabric version 1.3.60 or later, you can use the Runtime Fabric *Settings* page in Runtime Manager to enable mutual authentication for connectivity between the Runtime Fabric and Anypoint control plane. Mutual authentication improves the security of communication between Runtime Fabric and Anypoint Platform and is highly recommended. Runtime Fabric instances created after July 15, 2020 have the mutual authentication setting enabled by default.

Before enabling mutual authentication, verify the following endpoint and port are reachable from all Runtime Fabric controller and worker nodes:

* US control plane: 
** `configuration-resolver.prod.cloudhub.io:443`
* EU control plane:
** `configuration-resolver.prod-eu.msap.io:443`

[IMPORTANT]
Failure to meet the connectivity requirements above before enabling Mutual Authentication will result in errors while creating/managing application deployments in the Runtime Fabric.

You can use the latest version of the xref:install-rtfctl.adoc[rtfctl] utility to validate that all required endpoints are reachable from each Runtime Fabric controller node:

----
cd /opt/anypoint/runtimefabric
./rtfctl update
./rtfctl test outbound-network --mutual-tls-check
----
