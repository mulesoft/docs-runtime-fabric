[NOTE]
It's important to keep all nodes running and joined to the cluster for these instructions to be performed successfully. 
Alternatively, you can perform the first step and delete all applications and the Runtime Fabric on Runtime Manager, and 
skip the remaining steps by reimaging the VM disks.


.Using Runtime Manager delete all Mule applications running on Runtime Fabric.
+
Verify across all associated environments that you have removed all applications.

. Using Runtime Manager, delete the Runtime Fabric.
. On each Worker VM, run the following command and confirm by typing “yes” when prompted:
+
----
sudo gravity leave --force
----
. Run `gravity status` on any other node until the node is no longer visible when running `gravity status`.
. On each Worker VM, run the following commands sequentially:
+
----
sudo umount /var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd
sudo umount /var/lib/gravity

sudo rm -rf /opt/anypoint/runtimefabric /root/.gravity /home/rtf-user/.gravity /var/lib/gravity /tmp/gravity /tmp/gravity-wizard*

sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/install-teleport-*.service /etc/systemd/system/install-planet-*.service /etc/systemd/system/shrink-*.service /etc/systemd/system/gravity__gravitational.io__teleport__*.service /etc/systemd/system/gravity__gravitational.io__planet-*.service
----
. Remove lines in the `/etc/fstab` file which are appended with the comment `# Added by RTF`. 
. Restart the VM.
. Repeat steps 2 through 7 on each Controller VM.

[NOTE]
If the previous steps fail, a manual cleanup can be performed by running the following commands sequentially:

----
sudo systemctl stop gravity__gravitational.io__planet-*.service
sudo systemctl stop gravity__gravitational.io__teleport*.service

sudo systemctl disable gravity__gravitational.io__teleport__2.4.7.service
sudo systemctl disable gravity__gravitational.io__planet-master__5.0.8-1906.service

sudo gravity system uninstall --confirm

sudo umount /var/lib/gravity/planet/etcd
sudo umount /var/lib/gravity

sudo rm -rf /opt/anypoint/runtimefabric /root/.gravity /rtf-user/.gravity /var/lib/gravity /tmp/gravity /tmp/assets393106389 /tmp/gravity-wizard167466702 
----
Remove lines in the `/etc/fstab` file which are appended with the comment `# Added by RTF`.
