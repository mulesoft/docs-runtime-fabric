= Managing Mule Apps Schedules

You can use Anypoint Runtime Manager to view and control the Scheduler components within the flows in your deployed applications, all without changing the running application.
For example, you might want to disable a scheduled job while one of the applications is undergoing maintenance.
 
On the *Schedules* tab, you can:

* View the schedules in your running application.
* Change the schedules in your application.
* Run the scheduled job immediately, without changing the schedule.
* Disable or enable the schedule for a flow.

You configure Scheduler component types as either _fixed frequency_ to trigger at a regular interval or _cron_ to trigger at a date and time based on a specified cron expression.

[IMPORTANT]
To change a schedule type (between fixed frequency and cron or vice versa),
you must update and redeploy the app.
You can't change the schedule type on a deployed application.

[NOTE]
The minimum required Mule runtime engine version to use this feature is 4.1.2 or later, and the minimum Runtime Fabric Agent version is 2.0.0 or later.

[[design-schedule]]
== Schedule Design Considerations

When designing the schedule, consider the following:

* The Runtime Fabric scheduler reads the job configuration every time it runs.
+
When you update the scheduler configuration, the change takes effect the next time the scheduler runs.
* Changing the schedule redeploys your application.
* If a scheduled job is not triggered because the application is not running,
Runtime Fabric triggers the job as soon as the app restarts.
* Schedules are based in the scheduler's defined timezone.
* For multi-replica apps, Runtime Fabric runs scheduled jobs on all replicas.
+
If you run the scheduled job immediately by clicking *Run*, the scheduler runs on a single replica.
+
Runtime Fabric distributes multiple concurrent schedulers across replicas.
* You cannot manage Runtime Fabric schedules using scripts.
+
Use the *Schedules* tab or the Runtime Fabric API to manage Runtime Fabric schedules.
* Flow names can contain only upper and lower case latters, numbers, hyphens (`-`), underscores (`_`), and periods (`.`). The following characters are invalid: `/`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, and `#`.
* When you create a schedule using a scheduler that has a placeholder, the value that appears when you create a schedule varies based on when the placeholder is discovered. For example:
** If the value is available before the app is deployed, the value appears.
** If the value is available before deployment and depends on deployment properties, an estimation of the value appears.
** If the value is a placeholder (such as `${cronExpression}`) that is provided at the time of deployment, the exact value of the placeholder does not appear in the user interface.
** Runtime Fabric uses a default value of `60000`.
* If you make changes to schedulers, you should reupload the application to Exchange to ensure the expected scheduler behavior occurs.

== Before You Begin

To use the scheduling feature in Runtime Manager, deploy an application that includes one or more Scheduler elements using Anypoint Studio 7.13 or later.

image::ch2-scheduler-studio.png[Scheduler component in the Anypoint Studio canvas]

After you deploy the app, you can manage the schedule in Runtime Manager.
The app doesn't need to be running.

[Note]
Use Mule Maven facade v3 when you deploy through Maven to Runtime Fabric for the schedules to show in the Runtime Manager UI.

== View and Manage Application Schedules in Runtime Manager

After deploying an app to Runtime Fabric, view and manage the Scheduler elements in Runtime Manager:

// SELECT RTM APPS SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectAppsPage]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickAppName]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickSchedules]
+
Runtime Manager lists the Scheduler elements in the order they appear in your app:
+
image::ch2-scheduler-rtm.png[(1) Flow name and (2) the frequency link on the Schedulers page.]
+
** The *Name* column shows the name of the flow (1) that contains the Scheduler element.
** The frequency link (2) in the *Schedule* column shows the schedule for the element.
. If you want to see more information about when the jobs started and ended,
click *Logs* in the navigation menu:
+
image::ch2-logs-rtm.png[Logs option in the navigation menu.]
. Click the frequency link for an element to open the schedule editor.
+
The schedule editor you see depends on the schedule type:
+
* <<change-fixed-frequency-schedule,Fixed frequency>>
* <<change-cron-schedule,Cron>>
. In the schedule editor, change the schedule or deselect *Enabled* to disable the schedule.
. Click *Update* to save changed settings or click *Cancel* to exit without saving.

[[change-fixed-frequency-schedule]]
=== Change a Fixed Frequency Schedule

// SELECT RTM APPS SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectAppsPage]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickAppName]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickSchedules]
+
The *Schedule* column shows the schedule for the element:
+
image::ch2-scheduler-fixed-rtm.png[Fixed frequency schedule type]
. Click the frequency link for an element to open the schedule editor.
. In the schedule editor, change the schedule or deselect *Enabled* to disable the schedule:
+
image::ch2-scheduler-editor-fixed.png[Fixed-frequency schedule configuration]
+
You can specify milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, or days for the frequency.
The minimum recommended frequency between calls is 10 seconds.
. Click *Update* to save changed settings or click *Cancel* to exit without saving.


[[change-cron-schedule]]
=== Change a Cron Schedule

With cron expressions, you can create more complex schedule frequencies,
such as every 5 minutes between 9:00 am and 10:00 am on Fridays.

To change the frequency of a cron schedule type:

// SELECT RTM APPS SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectAppsPage]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickAppName]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickSchedules]
+
The *Schedule* column shows the schedule for the element:
+
image::ch2-scheduler-cron-rtm.png[cron schedule type]
. Click the frequency link for an element to open the schedule editor.
. In the schedule editor, change the schedule or deselect *Enabled* (1) to disable the schedule:
+
image::ch2-scheduler-editor-cron.png[cron schedule configuration with (1) Enabled option and (2)  Quick Reference link]
. In the schedule editor, click *Quick Reference* (2) to expand or collapse the table that lists required fields and allowed values.
+
The cron expression in this example sets the schedule to every 10 seconds.
+
For information about building cron triggers:
+
.. View the http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation[Quartz documentation^].
.. Select a version, click *Documentation > User's Guide > Tutorial*, and then click the *CronTrigger* lesson.
. Click *Update* to save changed settings or click *Cancel* to exit without saving.

[[run-immediately]]
== Run a Scheduled Job Immediately

If a job runs nightly but you want to debug it now, you can trigger the job
while it's running without updating the schedule in your application. When you trigger the job in between instances of the scheduler running, the timer for the indicated time period resets.

[NOTE]
If you run the scheduled job immediately, the scheduler runs on a single replica
even for multi-replica apps.

To override the schedule and run the job immediately:

// SELECT RTM APPS SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectAppsPage]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickAppName]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickSchedules]
. Select the elements to manage and then click *Run*.

[[disable-enable-scheduler]]
== Disable or Enable a Scheduler Element

You might want to disable a scheduled job if an application you are connecting
to is undergoing maintenance and then reenable it after maintenance is complete.

Runtime Fabric does not run the scheduled job until you reenable the Scheduler.

*Known issue*: If you disable the scheduler, it still runs when starting an application. If you want to prevent the scheduler from running, set the `startdelay` property to five seconds in your app using Anypoint Studio.

To disable the Scheduler element:

// SELECT RTM APPS SHARED
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=selectAppsPage]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickAppName]
include::partial$select-private-space.adoc[tag=clickSchedules]
. Select the elements to manage and then click *Disable*.
+
You can also disable or enable the schedule by deselecting or
selecting *Enabled* in the schedule editor.
+
