* xref:install-prereqs.adoc[Anypoint Runtime Fabric Installation Prerequisites]

[NOTE]
If you do not see the *Runtime Fabrics* tab in Runtime Manager as described below, contact your customer success manager to enable Anypoint Runtime Fabric for your account.

== Create a Runtime Fabric using Runtime Manager

. From Anypoint Platform, select Runtime Manager.
. Click *Runtime Fabrics*.

[NOTE]
After creating the Runtime Fabric, Runtime Manage displays the corresponding activation data. Record this data to be used later when installing the infrastucture.
