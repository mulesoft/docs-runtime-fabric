= Persistence Gateway

Anypoint Runtime Fabric provides Persistence Gateway, which enables Mule applications deployed to a Mule runtime instance to store and share data across application replicas and restarts.

[NOTE]
====
Persistence Gateway is supported on Anypoint Runtime Fabric 1.9 or later and Mule runtime engine 4.2.1 or later.
====

== Use Persistence Gateway in a Mule Application

After Persistence Gateway is configured in Anypoint Runtime Fabric, it is available for Mule applications deployed to Mule runtime engine, version 4.2.1 or later. When configured, users can select *Use Persistent Object Storage* when deploying an application using Runtime Manager. See xref:deploy-to-runtime-fabric.adoc[Deploy a Mule Application to Runtime Fabric] for more information.

Mule applications use the Object Store v2 REST API via the Object Store Connector to connect to Persistence Gateway. This enables you to deploy to both Anypoint Runtime Fabric and CloudHub without having to modify your Mule application. 

When an application using persistent object storage is deleted, Runtime Fabric deletes all information stored in Persistence Gateway.

== Persistent Gateway Limits

The following table lists the limits on the data stored by Persistence Gateway:

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
| Limit | Description
| Maximum TTL. | The amount of time data is stored in Persistence Gateway, value is set to 30 days.
|===


[Configure-Persistence-Gateway]
== Configure Persistence Gateway

To configure Persistence Gateway, you must create a Kubernetes custom resource that allows the cluster to connect to your persistence data store.

=== Prerequisites

Before enabling Persistence Gateway, ensure that you have created a database to serve as the data source for data stored by Persistence Gateway. This database must be compatible with PostgresSQL 9 and above. 

=== Create a Kubernetes Secret and Kubernetes Custom Resource

. Create a Kubernetes secret:
+
----
kubectl create secret generic persistence-gateway-creds -n rtf --from-literal=persistence-gateway-creds='postgres://username:pass@host:port/databasename'
----
+
[NOTE]
Do not use the "@" character in the database username. 

. Create a custom resource for your data store:
.. Copy the custom resource template from <<k8-custom-resource-template>> to a file called `custom-resource.yaml`.
.. Ensure the value of `secretRef: name` matches the `name` field defined in your Kubernetes secret file.
.. Modify other fields of the custom resource template as required for your environment.
.. Run `kubectl apply -f custom-resource.yaml`.

. Check the logs of the Persistence Gateway pod to ensure it can communicate with the database:
+
----
kubectl get pods -n rtf
----
+
Look for pods with the name prefix `persistence-gateway`
+
----
kubectl logs -f persistence-gateway-6dfb98949c-7xns9 -nrtf
----
+
The output of this command should be similar to the following:
+
----

[[k8-custom-resource-template]]
=== Kubernetes Custom Resource Template

Use the example template below to create a Kubernetes custom resource. This custom resource enables the Kubernetes cluster to connect to your data store.

----
apiVersion: rtf.mulesoft.com/v1
kind: PersistenceGateway
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: rtf
spec:
  objectStore:
    backendDriver: postgresql
    maxBackendConnectionPool: 20
    replicas: 2
    secretRef:
      name: persistence-gateway-creds
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 250m
        memory: 250Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 200m
        memory: 75Mi
----

Modify the following fields based on your environment:

[%header,cols="3*a"]
|===
| Field | Description | Default Value
| `kind` | The type of custom resource. The only supported value is `PersistenceGateway`. | PersistenceGateway
| `metadata.name` | The internal identifier for this custom resource. The value for this field should be `default`. | default
| `metadata.namespace` | The namespace where the secret is applied. The supported value is `rtf`. | rtf
| `spec.objectStore.backendDriver` | The driver used by the data store. Only `postgresql` is supported. | postgresql
| `spec.objectStore.maxBackendConnectionPool` | The maximum number of simultaneous open connections to the data store. | 20
| `spec.objectStore.replicas` | The number of replicas of Persistence Gateway. | 2
| `spec.objectStore.resources.limits.cpu` | The CPU resource limits for the Persistence Gateway pods. | 250m
| `spec.objectStore.resources.limits.memory` | The memory resource limits for the Persistence Gateway pods. | 150Mi
| `spec.objectStore.resources.requests.cpu` | The CPU resource requests for the Persistence Gateway pods. | 200m
| `spec.objectStore.resources.requests.memory` | The memory resource requests for the Persistence Gateway pods. | 75Mi
| `spec.objectStore.secretRef.name` | The name of the Persistence Gateway credentials defined in the Kubernetes secret file. | persistence-gateway-creds
|===

[NOTE]
====
The default CPU, memory, and limit values are based on a small number of deployed Mule applications. Modify these values based on the requirements of your environment.
