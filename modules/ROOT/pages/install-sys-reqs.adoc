Anypoint Runtime Fabric supports development and production configurations. The requirements 
for each configuration 
are described below. See xref:architecture.adoc[Runtime Fabric Architecture] for a 
description of these environments.

[WARNING]
Review these requirements with your operations and IT teams to ensure you have the right
infrastructure provisioned before installing Runtime Fabric.

== Operating System Requirements

Anypoint Runtime Fabric requires one of the following operating systems.

* Red Hat (RHEL) v7.4, v7.5, v7.6, v7.7
* CentOS v7.4, v7.5, v7.6, v7.7

Use the same operating system for each node. If you attempt to install Runtime Fabric on 
a different operating system version or distribution, the Runtime Fabric installer will fail.

== Hardware Requirements
Only x86 and x64 architectures are supported.

Runtime Fabric reserves up to 0.5 cores per worker node for internal services. This is important 
to know when determining the amount of CPU cores and worker nodes needed.

The Runtime Manager UI displays the amount of available CPU across worker nodes. For example,
given a cluster with 3 worker nodes, each with 2 cores, Runtime Fabric reserves a total of 0.9
cores (0.3 x 3). The number of available cores displayed in the Runtime Manager is 5.1 instead
of the full 6 cores.

Overprovisioning Runtime Fabric worker nodes is recommended to preserve uptime in the event a
node becomes unavailable or during maintenance operations such as OS patching.

== Production Configuration

A minimum of 6 nodes are required for a production configuration of Runtime Fabric as shown in
the following diagram.

[NOTE]
Runtime Fabric does not support running controller or worker nodes using burstable VMs.

The following sections describe the minimum system requirements of each controller and worker
nodes in a production configuration.

=== Controller Nodes

The number of controller nodes required for a production environment is three. 
Even numbers of controller nodes are not supported. These requirements reflect the minimum
requirements to maintain high-availability and ensure system performance.

Each contoller node must have the following:

** A minimum of 2 dedicated cores.
** 8 GiB memory minimum.
** 80 GiB dedicated disk for the operating system.
*** 20 GiB or more for `/tmp` directory.
*** 8 GiB or more for `/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric` directory.
*** 1 GiB or more for `/var/log/` directory.
** 60 GiB dedicated disk with 3000 provisioned IOPS for etcd. This translates to a minimum of 12
Megabytes per second.
(MBps) disk read/write performance.
** 250 GiB dedicated disk with 1000 provisioned IOPS for Docker. This translates to a minimum of
4 MBps disk read/write performance.

[NOTE]
Dedicated disks are required to ensure optimum performance. The Runtime Fabric installer formats
and mounts the disks needed during installation.

=== Worker Nodes

Runtime Fabric requires at least three worker nodes to run Mule applications and API gateways.
The maximum number of worker nodes supported is 16.

Each worker node must have the following:

** A minimum of 2 dedicated cores.
** 15 GiB memory minimum.
** 80 GiB dedicated disk for the operating system.
*** 20 GiB or more for `/tmp` directory.
*** 8 GiB or more for `/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric` directory.
*** 1 GiB or more for `/var/log/` directory.
** 250 GiB dedicated disk with 1000 provisioned IOPS for Docker. This translates to a minimum 
of 4 MBps disk read/write performance.

[NOTE]
Dedicated disks are required to ensure optimum performance. The Runtime Fabric installer 
formats and mounts the disks needed during installation.

=== Additional Resource Requirements for Production Environments

When using Runtime Fabric in a production environment, you must have the following components:

* An external load balancer if incoming traffic is enabled to Runtime Fabric. A TCP
load balancer with a server pool consisting of each of the controller nodes is sufficient.
* At least one additional worker node, including hard disks. If preserving uptime for the cluster and applications 
is necessary, you will need additional resources when updating the operating system or other packages that require 
restarts. Also use the additional node when:

** Performing rolling upgrades to major versions of Runtime Fabric
** Performing operating system level patches.

== Development Configuration

Runtime Fabric requires a minimum of three nodes in a development environment as shown in the
following diagram:

[NOTE]
Runtime Fabric does not support running controller or worker nodes using burstable VMs.

The following sections describe the minimum system requirements of each controller and worker
nodes in a development configuration.

=== Controller Nodes

The number of controller nodes required for a production environment is three. Even numbers of
controllers are not supported.

Each contoller node must have the following:

** A minimum of 2 dedicated cores.
** 8 GiB memory minimum.
** 80 GiB dedicated disk for the operating system.
*** 20 GiB or more for `/tmp` directory.
*** 8 GiB or more for `/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric` directory.
*** 1 GiB or more for `/var/log/` directory.
** 60 GiB dedicated disk with 3000 provisioned IOPS for etcd. This translates to a minimum of 12
Megabytes per second (MBps) disk read/write performance.
** 100 GiB dedicated disk with 1000 provisioned IOPS for Docker. This translates to a minimum of
4 MBps disk read/write performance.

[NOTE]
Dedicated disks are required to ensure optimum performance. The Runtime Fabric installer formats
and mounts the disks needed during installation.

=== Worker Nodes

Runtime Fabric requires at least two worker nodes to run Mule applications and API gateways. 
The maximum number of workers nodes supported is 16.

Each worker node must have the following:

** A minimum of 2 dedicated cores.
** 15 GiB memory minimum.
** 80 GiB dedicated disk for the operating system.
*** 20 GiB or more for `/tmp` directory.
*** 8 GiB or more for `/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric` directory.
*** 1 GiB or more for `/var/log/` directory.
** 100 GiB dedicated disk with 1000 provisioned IOPS for Docker. This translates to a minimum 
of 4 MBps disk read/write performance.

[NOTE]
Dedicated disks are required to ensure optimum performance. The Runtime Fabric installer 
formats and mounts the disks needed during installation.

=== Additional Resource Requirements for Development Environments

To keep your Runtime Fabric running during upgrades, at least one additional worker node is
required, including hard disks. This node should only be used when:

* Performing rolling upgrades to major versions of Runtime Fabric
* Performing operating system level patches.
