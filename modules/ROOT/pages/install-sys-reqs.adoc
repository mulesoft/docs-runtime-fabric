Anypoint Runtime Fabric supports development and production configurations. The requirements for each configuration 
are described below. See xref:architecture.adoc[Runtime Fabric Architecture] for a description of these environments.

[WARNING]
Review these requirements with your operations and IT teams to ensure you have the right infrastructure provisioned 
before installing Runtime Fabric.

== Operating System Requirements

Anypoint Runtime Fabric requires one of the following operating systems.

* Red Hat (RHEL) v7.4, v7.5, v7.6
* CentOS v7.4, v7.5, v7.6

Use the same operating system for each VM. If you attempt to install Runtime Fabric on another operating system version 
or distribution, the Runtime Fabric installer fails.

== Hardware Requirements
Runtime Fabric reserves a fixed amount of CPU, 0.3 cores per worker VM, for internal services. This is an important factor when determining the amount of CPU cores and worker nodes needed.

The Runtime Manager UI displays the amount of available CPU across worker VMs. For example, given a cluster with 3 worker 
VMs, each with 2 cores, Runtime Fabric reserves a total of 0.9 cores (0.3 x 3). The number of available cores displayed 
in the Runtime Manager is 5.1 instead of the full 6 cores.

Overprovisioning RTF worker nodes is recommended to preserve uptime in the event a node becomes unavailable or during
maintenance operations such as OS patching.

== Production Configuration

A minimum of 6 VMs are required for a production configuration of Runtime Fabric as shown in the following diagram.

The following sections describe the minimum system requirements of each controller and worker VMs in a production
configuration.

=== Controller VMs

The minimum number of controller VMs in a production environment is three. The maximum is five, and even numbers of
controllers are not supported. These requirements reflect the minimum requirements to maintain high-availability and 
ensure system performance.

Each contoller VM must have the following:

** 2 cores each minimum.
** 8 GiB memory minimum.
** 80 GiB dedicated disk for the operating system.
*** 20 GiB or more for `/tmp` directory.
*** 8 GiB or more for `/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric` directory.
*** 1 GiB or more for `/var/log/` directory.
** 60 GiB dedicated disk with 3000 provisioned IOPS for etcd. This translates to a minimum of 12 Megabytes per second 
(MBps) disk read/write performance.
** 250 GiB dedicated disk with 1000 provisioned IOPS for Docker. This translates to a minimum of 4 MBps disk read/write
performance.

[NOTE]
Dedicated disks are required to ensure optimum performance. The Runtime Fabric installer formats and mounts the 
disks needed during installation.

=== Worker VMs

Runtime Fabric requires at least three worker VMs to run Mule applications and API gateways. The maximum number of 
worker VMs supported is 16.

Each worker VM must have the following:

** 2 cores each minimum.
** 15 GiB memory minimum.
** 80 GiB dedicated disk for the operating system.
*** 20 GiB or more for `/tmp` directory.
*** 8 GiB or more for `/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric` directory.
*** 1 GiB or more for `/var/log/` directory.
** 250 GiB dedicated disk with 1000 provisioned IOPS for Docker. This translates to a minimum of 4 MBps disk read/write
performance.

[NOTE]
Dedicated disks are required to ensure optimum performance. The Runtime Fabric installer formats and mounts the 
disks needed during installation.

=== Additional Resource Requirements for Production Environments

To use Runtime Fabric in a production environments, you must also have the following:

* An external load balancer: required if incoming traffic is enabled to Runtime Fabric. A TCP load balancer with a 
server pool consisting of each of the controller VMs is sufficient.
* At least one additional worker VM, including hard disks. This VM should be used when:
  ** Performing rolling upgrades to major versions of Runtime Fabric
  ** Performing operating system level patches.

== Development Configuration

Runtime Fabric requires a minimum of three VMs in a development environment as shown in the following diagram:

The following sections describe the minimum system requirements of each controller and worker VMs in a 
development configuration.

=== Controller VM

Runtime Fabric requires at least one controller VM in a development environment. The maximum supported is five, and 
even numbers of controllers are not supported.

Each contoller VM must have the following:

** 2 cores each minimum
** 8 GiB memory minimum
** 80 GiB dedicated disk for the operating system.
*** 20 GiB or more for `/tmp` directory.
*** 8 GiB or more for `/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric` directory.
*** 1 GiB or more for `/var/log/` directory.
** 60 GiB dedicated disk with 3000 provisioned IOPS for etcd. This translates to a minimum of 12 Megabytes per second 
(MBps) disk read/write performance.
** 100 GiB dedicated disk with 1000 provisioned IOPS for Docker. This translates to a minimum of 4 MBps disk read/write
performance.

[NOTE]
Dedicated disks are required to ensure optimum performance. The Runtime Fabric installer formats and mounts the 
disks needed during installation.

=== Worker VMs

Runtime Fabric requires at least two worker VMs to run Mule applications and API gateways. The maximum number of 
workers VMs supported is 16.

Each worker VM must have the following:

** 2 cores each minimum.
** 15 GiB memory minimum.
** 80 GiB dedicated disk for the operating system.
*** 20 GiB or more for `/tmp` directory.
*** 8 GiB or more for `/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric` directory.
*** 1 GiB or more for `/var/log/` directory.
** 100 GiB dedicated disk with 1000 provisioned IOPS for Docker. This translates to a minimum of 4 MBps disk read/write
performance.

[NOTE]
Dedicated disks are required to ensure optimum performance. The Runtime Fabric installer formats and mounts the 
disks needed during installation.

=== Additional Resource Requirements for Development Environments

To keep your Runtime Fabric running during upgrades, at least one additional worker VM is required, including hard 
disks. This VM should only be used when:

* Performing rolling upgrades to major versions of Runtime Fabric
* Performing operating system level patches.
