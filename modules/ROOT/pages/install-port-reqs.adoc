= Network and Port Requirements for Anypoint Runtime Fabric
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]

Anypoint Runtime Fabric requires specific network and port configuration for installation and operation.

== Bandwidth Requirements

A high bandwidth network is required, with a minimum of 1 GBps connectivity between each node operating Anypoint Runtime Fabric, and minimum of 100 MBps for outbound connectivity to the Internet. 
[NOTE]
Cross-regional deployments of Anypoint Runtime Fabric are not supported. Network latency between each node can cause problems with cluster health.

== Required Port Settings

The following sections list the TCP and UDP network port requirements for Anypoint Runtime Fabric.

=== Ports Used During Installation

The following table lists the ports that must be accessible on all nodes. These ports are used for internal communication between nodes during Anypoint Runtime Fabric installation. After completing the installation, you can safely disable these ports.

== Port IPs and Hostnames to Whitelist

In your network configuration, you must whitelist the hostnames and ports of Anypoint Platform components 
and services to enable Anypoint Runtime Fabric to communicate with them. This is also required to download 
dependencies during installation and upgrades.

The following table lists the ports and hostnames to add to your whitelists to allow communication between 
Anypoint Runtime Fabric and Anypoint Platform.

Because the following endpoints use mutual TLS authentication to establish the connection, you must configure SSL passthrough to allow the following certificate:

* US control plane
** `transport-layer.prod.cloudhub.io`
** `configuration-resolver.prod.cloudhub.io`
* EU control plane
** `transport-layer.prod-eu.msap.io`
** `configuration-resolver.prod-eu.msap.io`

== Required Network Settings

In addition to the previous port requirements, the following network settings are required to operate 
Anypoint Runtime Fabric:

* A subnet with enough IP addresses allotable to add additional VMs to Anypoint Runtime Fabric.
* Shell/SSH access to each VM used to install Anypoint Runtime Fabric.
* Static private IPv4 addresses assigned to each VM, which persist between restarts.
* Kernel IP forwarding to enable internal Kubernetes load balancing. IPv4 forwarding is enabled on each VM during installation.
* Bridge-netfilter to enable the host Linux kernel to translate packets to and from hosted containers. This kernel module is enabled on each VM during installation.
* Access to an SMTP server to manage e-mail alerts triggered by Anypoint Runtime Fabric.
* An external load balancer to balance external requests to the internal load balancer running on each controller VM.
* Your environment's HTTP proxy configuration if outgoing requests to the Internet must route through a proxy.
* A SOCKS5 proxy for Anypoint Monitoring and Visualizer support if outgoing requests to the Internet must route through a proxy.
