Runtime Fabric enables you to send alerts through an existing SMTP server. Runtime Fabric provides alert functionality to send notifications when system health is compromised.

== Install rtfctl 

The `rtfctl` utility is required to manage alert sender email on Runtime Fabric. Perform the steps in xref:install-rtfctl.adoc[Install rtfctl] before completing the following steps.

== Procedure

. Using a terminal, open a shell/SSH connection to a controller VM.
. Create a file named `alert-smtp.yaml` that contains the following:
+
----
kind: smtp
version: v2
metadata:
  name: smtp
spec:
  host: <smtp host>
  port: <smtp port>
  username: <username>
  password: <password>
---
kind: alerttarget
version: v2
metadata:
  name: email-alerts
spec:
  email: <email>
----

. Modify the contents of `alert-smtp.yaml` using the following values specific to your environment:
+
[%header,cols="2*a"]
.Environment Variables
|===
|Key | Description
|`<smtp host>` | The endpoint of the SMTP server.
|`<smtp port>` | The port used to connect to the SMTP server. (465 by default).
|`<username>` | The username to use when connecting to the SMTP server.
|`<password>` | The password to use when connecting to the SMTP server.
|`<email>` | The recipient email address.

|===
+
. Run the following on the controller VM.
+
----
$ sudo gravity resource create -f alert-smtp.yaml
----

. Use the `rtfctl` utility to set the alert sender email address containing your SMTP domain. Use a distinguishable email address for each cluster to identify the cluster triggering the alert.
+
----
$ sudo ./rtfctl appliance apply alert-smtp-from "sender@example.com"
----

Alerts with the designated alert sender email address are now configured to be sent through your SMTP server.

[NOTE]
Currently, only one alerts email recipient is supported.
