// tag::createTemplate[]

. Copy the example template into a new file and modify it according to the notes. 
. Include a `.yaml` extension in the file name. 
. To apply an ingress template, run:
+
[source,copy]
--
kubectl apply -f <TEMPLATE_FILENAME.yaml>
--

If there is an issue in the template, Kubernetes `api-server` returns an error and the command fails. 

After you apply a template successfully, you can view it with:

[source,copy]
--
kubectl describe ingress [Ingress Name] -n rtf
--
// end::createTemplate[]

// tag::configureIngressRuntimeManager[]

You configure ingress for an application when you deploy it to Runtime Fabric using Runtime Manager. Available hosts and paths for an application come from the ingress resource template configured by the Runtime Fabric administrator. 

You can also use this procedure to deploy a test application to validate your ingress resource template.
 
[NOTE]
====
The following provides an overview of how to configure ingress for an application.
Refer to xref:deploy-to-runtime-fabric.adoc[Deploy a Mule Application to Runtime Fabric] for complete deployment instructions.
If you are using the Mule Maven plugin to deploy applications to Runtime Fabric, the deployment settings parameter `publicUrl` in the block `http` can accept a comma-delimited string of multiple endpoints. 
For more information, see xref:mule-runtime::deploy-to-rtf#deploymentsettings-parameters-reference[deploymentSettings Parameters Reference].
==== 

. Navigate to Runtime Manager and follow the documentation to deploy an application to Runtime Fabric.
. Select *Ingress*.
. From the *Host* drop-down list, select a host for the application. 
. If the hostname uses a wildcard, add a subdomain in the *Subdomain* field. 
+
The *Subdomain* field is only available if the hostname uses a wildcard.
. In the *Path* field, add a URL path to the applicationâ€™s endpoint:
