== Before you install Anypoint Runtime Fabric (Runtime Fabric):

* Make sure your environment meets all the general, system, and network prerequisites. If needed, contact your MuleSoft representative for assistance.
* Make sure you have knowledge in the following areas:

** Linux system commands.
** Working in Linux with root access. Installation requires root access (permission to run the sudo command) on all servers in your environment.
** Working with Terraform. This is only required if your environment includes AWS.
** Remote connection mechanisms, such as SSL and SSH.

== General Prerequisites for Anypoint Runtime Fabric

The following sections list the general requirements and considerations for successfully using Anypoint Runtime Fabric. Ensure the following criteria have been met before beginning the installation.

Consult your network or operations administrators to ensure that these are in place before installing Anypoint Runtime Fabric.

=== Anypoint Platform Roles and Permissions

To succesfully use Anypoint Runtime Fabric, your Anypoint Platform account must have the following roles and permissions enabled:

* Ability to use Anypoint Runtime Manager to deploy and manage applications.
* Ability to use Anypoint Access Management to manage permissions for Anypoint Platform users.
** To use Anypoint Runtime Fabric, you must have the *Organization Administrators* role or the *Manage Runtime Fabrics* permission on the corresponding environments.
* You may also require the following permissions to enable inbound traffic to Runtime Fabric:
** Grant Access to Secrets
** Manage Secret Groups
** Read Secrets Metadata
** Write Secrets
+
These permissions are available from the *Secrets Manager* tab in Access Management .
** To deploy applications, you must have the *Exchange Contributors* role enabled for your Anypoint Platform account.

=== Network and Security

To successfully install and use Anypoint Runtime Fabric, you must know and verify the following about your network:

* Your organization requires outbound connections to be routed to a proxy.
* Outbound access is allowed using websockets (via port 443) to Anypoint Platform.
* Your organization's network and security policies, including:
** Internal network IP address range in CIDR notation.
** The subnet range used for Runtime Fabric in CIDR notation.
** If virtual machines are allowed public IP addresses.
** How to gain shell access to each VM.
* Know if inbound traffic should be enabled for Anypoint Runtime Fabric. This will likely be based on the function of your organization's Mule applications.
** If so, you must have a TLS certificate with the desired Common Name set to route traffic to Runtime Fabric.
** Ability to create or configure an external TCP load balancer to manage traffic to applications running in Runtime Fabric.
** Ability to configure DNS settings to associate the Common Name on the TLS certificate to the IP address of the external load balancer.

=== Infrastructure and Operations

To successfully install and use Anypoint Runtime Fabric, your network infrastructure must have:

* Required hardware provisioned, or have enough quota with your infrastructure provider to create the required hardware. This includes:
** Virtual machines
** Disks with provisioned IOPS
** Virtual networks
** Firewall rules / security groups
** Load balancers
* If provisioning hardware with AWS or Azure, you must have the right permissions to create the above resources.
* You must understand how to forward logs to your organization's logging provider.
* Details on your organization's SMTP provider to configure alerts.

=== Mule

To deploy Mule applications and API proxies, you must have the following:

* Access to your organization's Mule license key(s).
* One or more Mule applications.

== System Requirements for Anypoint Runtime Fabric

Anypoint Runtime Fabric supports development and production configurations. The requirements 
for each configuration are described in the following sections. 
See xref:architecture.adoc[Runtime Fabric Architecture] for a description of these environments.

[WARNING]
Review these requirements with your operations and IT teams to ensure your
infrastructure is provisioned correctly before installing Runtime Fabric. 
The Runtime Fabric installation process fails if the minimum requirements are not met.

The default behavior of the AWS and Azure provisioning scripts creates a set of virtual machines and disks defined by 
the minimum requirements. It also creates a private network with the required network ports configured. This is optimal 
when evaluating Runtime Fabric before integrating within your primary network. You should consult with your 
network administrator to determine if the default behavior is compatible. You may need to modify the 
provisioning scripts to accommodate your organization's requirements.

What info is needed for these items????

* Have 2 rtf cluster, one for DMZ and one for internal
* Have multiple clustering within DMZ/internal for HA
* Disable swap memory
* RTF default pod & services CIDR block should not interfere with regions network
* chrony (system clocks) status should in sync 

== Operating System Requirements

Anypoint Runtime Fabric requires one of the following operating systems.

* Red Hat (RHEL) v7.4, v7.5, v7.6, v7.7
* CentOS v7.4, v7.5, v7.6, v7.7

Use the same operating system for each node. If you attempt to install Runtime Fabric on 
a different operating system version or distribution, the Runtime Fabric installer fails.

== Hardware Requirements
Only x86 and x64 architectures are supported.

[NOTE]
Dedicated disks are required to ensure optimum performance. The Runtime Fabric installer formats
and mounts the disks needed during installation.

== Production Configuration Requirements

A minimum of 6 nodes are required for a production configuration of Runtime Fabric as shown in
the following diagram.

image::architecture-production.png[]

The following sections describe the minimum system requirements of each controller and worker
nodes in a production configuration.

[NOTE]
Runtime Fabric does not support running controller nodes using burstable VMs. When deploying an application on a worker node, you can allocate vCPU for bursting. see xref:deploy-resource-allocation.adoc[Resource Allocation and Performance on Anypoint Runtime Fabric] for additional information.

=== Controller Nodes

The minimum number of controller nodes required for a production environment is three. This requirement reflects 
the minimum requirements to maintain high-availability and ensure system performance.

An odd number of controller nodes is required for fault tolerance. Even numbers of controller nodes are not supported. 

The maximum number of supported controller nodes is 5.

Each controller node must have the following:

** A minimum of 2 dedicated cores.
** A minimum of 8 GiB memory for each dedicated core.
+
You must consider the amount of resources needed for the internal load balancer when sizing controller nodes. For additional information, refer to xref:deploy-resource-allocation#internal-load-balancer[Internal Load Balancer] resource allocation.
** A minimum of 80 GiB dedicated disk for the operating system.
*** A minimum of 20 GiB for `/tmp` directory.
*** A minimum of 8 GiB for `/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric` directory.
*** A minimum of 1 GiB for `/var/log/` directory.
** A minimium of 60 GiB dedicated disk with at least 3000 provisioned IOPS to run the etcd distributed database. This translates to a minimum of 12 Megabytes per second (MBps) disk read/write performance.

*** This disk is referred to as the `etcd` device.
** A minimum of 250 GiB dedicated disk with 1000 provisioned IOPS for Docker overlay and other internal services. This translates to a minimum of
4 MBps disk read/write performance.

*** This disk is referred to as the `docker` device.

==== Scaling Considerations

Consider scaling the number of controller nodes in the following situations:

* Fault tolerance is needed to mitigate the impact of controller node hardware failure. The minimum requirement of 3 controller nodes enables fault-tolerance of losing 1 controller. To improve fault-tolerance to lose 2 controllers, a total of 5 controllers should be configured.
* Production traffic is being served with applications running on Runtime Fabric.

=== Worker Nodes

Runtime Fabric requires at least three worker nodes to run Mule applications and API gateways.

The maximum number of worker nodes supported is 16.

Provision at least one extra worker node to preserve uptime in the event a
node becomes unavailable (fault-tolerance) or during maintenance operations that require restarts, such as OS patching.

This enables safe removal of a worker node from the cluster to apply upgrades, without impacting availability of applications. 


[NOTE]
====
Runtime Fabric can reserve up to 0.5 cores per worker node for internal services. This is important 
when determining the amount of CPU cores and worker nodes needed.

For example, your Runtime Fabric could have three worker nodes and two CPU cores for each worker node. If Runtime Fabric reserves 0.3 cores per worker node, a total of 0.9 cores, the number of available cores displayed in Runtime Manager is 5.1 vCPU instead of 6 vCPU.
====

Each worker node must have the following:

** A minimum of 2 dedicated cores. 
** A minimum of 15 GiB memory for each dedicated core.
+
You must consider how many Mules and tokenizers you plan to run on Runtime Fabric, and what they are licensed to deploy. Plan on approximately 0.5 cores per worker node for overhead.
** A minimum of 80 GiB dedicated disk for the operating system.
*** A minimum of  20 GiB for `/tmp` directory.
*** A minimum of 8 GiB for `/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric` directory.
*** A minimum of 1 GiB for `/var/log/` directory.
** A minimium of 250 GiB dedicated disk with at least 1000 provisioned IOPS for Docker overlay and other internal services. This translates to a minimum of 4 MBps disk read/write performance.
+ 
Having 250 GiB ensures there is enough space to run applications, cache docker images, provide temporary storage for running applications, and provide log storage.

=== Additional Resource Requirements for Production Environments

When using Runtime Fabric in a production environment:

* An external load balancer must be configured to load balance external requests to the internal load balancer 
running on each controller VM, with a health check configured for TCP port 443. A TCP load balancer with a 
server pool consisting of each of the controller nodes is sufficient.
* An internal load balancer that runs on at least 3 replicas to maintain availability.
* Applications serving inbound requests must be scaled to a minimum of 2 replicas.

== Development Configuration

Runtime Fabric requires a minimum of three nodes in a development environment as shown in the
following diagram:

image::architecture-development.png[]

[NOTE]
Runtime Fabric does not support running controller nodes using burstable VMs. When deploying an application on a worker node, you can allocate vCPU for bursting. see xref:deploy-resource-allocation.adoc[Resource Allocation and Performance on Anypoint Runtime Fabric] for additional information.

The following sections describe the minimum system requirements of each controller and worker
nodes in a development configuration.

=== Controller Nodes

The minimum number of controller nodes required for a non-production environment is one. Even numbers of
controllers are not supported.

The maximum number of supported controller nodes is 5.

Each controller node must have the following:

** A minimum of 2 dedicated cores.
** A minimum of 8 GiB memory.
** A minimum of 80 GiB dedicated disk for the operating system.
*** A minimum of 20 GiB for `/tmp` directory.
*** A minimum of 8 GiB for `/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric` directory.
*** A minimum of 1 GiB for `/var/log/` directory.
** A minimum of 60 GiB dedicated disk with 3000 provisioned IOPS for etcd. This translates to a minimum of 12
Megabytes per second (MBps) disk read/write performance.
** A minimum of 100 GiB dedicated disk with 1000 provisioned IOPS for Docker overlay and other internal services. This translates to a minimum of
4 MBps disk read/write performance.

=== Worker Nodes

Runtime Fabric requires at least two worker nodes to run Mule applications and API gateways. 
The maximum number of workers nodes supported is 16.

Provision at least one extra worker node to preserve uptime in the event a
node becomes unavailable (fault-tolerance) or during maintenance operations that require restarts, such as OS patching.

This enables safe removal of a worker node from the cluster to apply upgrades, without impacting availability of applications. 

[NOTE]
====
Runtime Fabric can reserve up to 0.5 cores per worker node for internal services. This is important 
when determining the amount of CPU cores and worker nodes needed.

For example, your Runtime Fabric could have three worker nodes and two CPU cores for each worker node. If Runtime Fabric reserves 0.3 cores per worker node, a total of 0.9 cores, the number of available cores displayed in Runtime Manager is 5.1 vCPU instead of 6 vCPU.
====

Each worker node must have the following:

** A minimum of 2 dedicated cores.
** A minimum of 15 GiB memory.
** A minimum of 80 GiB dedicated disk for the operating system.
*** A minimum of 20 GiB for `/tmp` directory.
*** A minimum of 8 GiB for `/opt/anypoint/runtimefabric` directory.
*** A minimum of 1 GiB for `/var/log/` directory.
** A minimum of 100 GiB dedicated disk with at least 1000 provisioned IOPS for Docker overlay and other internal services. This translates to a minimum of 4 MBps disk read/write performance.
+
Having 100 GiB ensures there is enough space to run applications, cache docker images, provide temporary storage for running applications, and provide log storage.

== Installation Considerations

During installation, the installation package is downloaded to a controller VM that serves as the leader of the installation.

Anypoint Runtime Fabric is configured to run as a cluster across multiple virtual machines. Each VM acts as one of two roles:

* Controller VMs are dedicated to operate and run Runtime Fabric services. The internal load balancer also runs within these VMs.
* Worker VMs are dedicated to run Mule applications.

One controller VM acts as a leader during the installation. This VM downloads the installer and makes it accessible to each other VM on port 32009. Other VMs copy the installer files from the leader, perform the installation, and join the leader to form a cluster.

During the installation, a set of pre-flight checks run to verify the minimum hardware, operating system, and network requirements for Runtime Fabric xref:install-sys-reqs.adoc[as defined]. If these requirements are not met, the installer will fail.

The installation process combines the following steps:

* For AWS and Azure, provision infrastructure per the system requirements.
* Install Runtime Fabric across the VMs.
* Activate Runtime Fabric with your Anypoint organization.
* Install your organization's Mule Enterprise license.

To complete these steps, specify environment variables for each VM at the beginning of installation. The leader requires additional variables to activate and add the Mule license. A script runs on each VM to perform the following actions:

* Format and mount each dedicated disk
* Add mount entries for each disk to `/etc/fstab`
* Add iptable rules
* Enable required kernel modules
* Start the installation

On the controller VM acting as the leader for installation, the following are performed:

* Run the activation script after installation
* Run the Mule license insertion script after registration
